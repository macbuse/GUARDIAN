      "If Ukraine is offered membership, then why should it continue to be denied to the states of the western Balkans or, indeed, to the Caucasus (Georgia also made considerable sacrifices)?\n",
      "Moreover, if Serbia in particular is brought into the EU and receives transfer payments which improve its living standards in line with other central European countries, it is far less likely to be played by Russia.\n",
      "In addition, if Ukraine, the western Balkans and the Caucasus, then why not Turkey also? Turkey, an ancient enemy of Russia, has only turned towards Russia because is was strung along in the late 1990s and early 2000s. If Turkey were folded into the EU, it would be much more willing to exercise suasion over Russia by closing the Straits, making it very much harder for Russia to project power in the Middle East, especially from Tartus.\n",
      "If is not only that membership was denied Ukraine because of Russia's visceral reaction against associate membership in 2008, but because for all its Gaullist talk about a Europe 'from the Atlantic to the Urals' France has wanted a 'little Europe', which it is easier for it to 'lead' and Germany (along with the other 'frugals') has been anxious about the burden of transfer payments. However, such has been the bouleversement of so many of Germany's policy predicates over the last two weeks, that France may perceive the abandonment of a 'little Europe' worthwhile if the crisis can be used to get Germany to agree to a more generous financial settlement within the EU. This may be especially true if Macron wins decisively next month, as now seems likely.\n",

      "For years other Europeans (for I consider myself European, whatever Brexit may have done to U.K. passport colours!) have told us that a major reason for the EU was to preserve peace through unity. Now we find ourselves obliged to cooperate in the face of what is happening. And if we think this is Putin’s last adventure - we are naive! Fragmentation suits him just fine! \n",
      "Is Ukraine perfectly governed? No. But then neither is the U.K. Look at the low key anti democratic moves of this government, the London Money Laundromat they have ignored/encouraged. \n",
      "But neither does any of that argue for why Ukraine should not be accepted swiftly into the “waiting room” for the EU, nor why the U.K. should not swiftly reverse at least some of our self imposed separation and clean up our act! \n",
      "Even some of the less admirable leaders around the place (E.g. Erdogan, Orban) have swiftly realised the danger Putin poses and come, at least partly, on side. Germany has made the most remarkable about face, finally realising intent is not enough, you have to be able to back it up with actions. \n",

      "Neville Chamberlain, the British Prime Minister, was keen to avoid war. He believed this could be achieved through the use of negotiation, agreements and diplomacy. His policy was to appease Hitler, which usually meant giving in to Hitler’s territorial demands.This included Britain not ‘getting tough’ on Germany when it rearmed and invaded the Rhineland, and its invasion of Czechoslovakia.The most famous example of appeasement is Chamberlain signing the Munich agreement which resulted in Germany taking the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Chamberlain hoped this would be the end of Hitler’s demands, although other politicians such as Churchill warned otherwise.I am not saying the world should go to war,but it seems the UK has not learned from history which is no surprise with who we have running this so called government of corruption through Russian interests.When a government takes money from oligarchs with well known links to Putin i would call it appeasement and treason.\n",

      "In interesting difference between the EU and Russia is that we hardly shelled cities in the UK after Brexit, at least not that I can remember. Apart from the economical aspects: the whole point of the EU is to keep the continent together after centuries of wars. In that sense it is the island mentality of the UK that helped to cause Brexit, in the rest of Europe there was generally more sense of belonging together in a big world with a lot of less big countries around (China, Russia, USA to mention a few). After this brutal action, that sense has increased tenfold and although this will go down it will likely hold at a higher level than before. Even in the economical sense it is not true: investing money in poorer states is an effort, but in the end also helps the donating country. the Netherlands have always been net payers to the EU - but got manifold profits back due to increased trade. See it as a yearly subscription to a shop or service where then everything is 10% off - it is often worth the fee!\n",

The EU and the West generally should be working behind the scenes with Ukraine and Russia to bring about a ceasefire to save lives, both Ukrainian and Russian. The West should then strengthen their economic sanctions ever tighter to squeeze the oligarchs and Putin's cronies. Yes, ordinary Russians will suffer too but in 5-10 years, Putin's regime will fail as did the USSR, perhaps even sooner.

      "Likely, most of what you think you know about Malone is based on reading or hearing various know-nothings repeating Malone's own self-promotion.3 decades ago, under someone else's direction, Malone did a couple of experiments whose results suggested it was possible to get controlled transient expression of foreign proteins in mammalian cells, by temporarily stabilizing the mRNA and transfecting it into the cells ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2762315/ ). After publishing that result, he appeared as a middle author on a handful of papers that attempted to further the transfection technology he had worked with.While he has since had a successful career in biotech -- including vaccine technology -- and he seems to have contributed to the development of, for example, some DNA transfection technologies, AFAICT he hasn't in the last 25 years published much about mRNA that is noteworthy. He may indeed be an expert in mRNA vaccine technology, but if so it isn't -- again, AFACIT -- because he's ever successfully developed one, either in a human or in a lab animal.Most significantly, he categorically is not \"the inventor\" of mRNA vaccines, a title he has given to himself and then promulgated through gullible media types like Rogan. As a graduate student working under supervision, he made an early, significant contribution -- mainly a proof of concept. It took another 25 years before the work of hundreds of other scientists brought that concept to fruition, with a technology that is not, as it happens, directly based on the technique Malone published, which had long before been abandoned ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3597572/ ).He comes across as an embittered egomaniac, of a sort that almost all who work in **SCIENCE** have encountered (see: Didier Raoult): They make hyperbolic and grandiose claims about the significance of their own ideas and work, dismiss and undermine the ideas and work of others, and end up in conflict (often, over credit) with people who try to work with them.Thus, the problem with bringing Malone on as an expert is that we cannot separate his interest in sharing his viewpoint from his interest in tearing down the people whose success is eating away at his liver. They're getting paid, and he isn't. They're getting interviewed on CNN and in the NYT and he isn't. He's the genius, and they're the pedestrian drones, but they're all fabulously wealthy and courting the Swedish Committee. The injustice of it all!\n",

      "The trouble is that this has repeatedly been shown to be incorrect. People have many reasons for accepting a fact as true or not, it actually being true is not always one of those reasons. The most obvious example of this is that literally no one thinks that a way to reduce racism in society would be to have more racists given time on news programs to explain why they are racist.\n",
      "In the same way, allowing debate between people were right on climate change and people who were wrong did not stop people believing those demonstrably wrong things about climate change, it simply exposed more people to them. It set action on climate change back thirty years. \n",
      "What has actually turned the tide on public opinion on climate change has been denying people spreading misinformation on climate change a platform. News programs have been lobbied not to get on prominent climate **SCIENCE** deniers, scientists have refused to appear on programs with them, newspapers have refused to print them and websites delete comments which feature climate **SCIENCE** denial. In this way debate is allowed to focus on the actual issues around climate change, rather than constantly being around whether misinformation is misinformation or not.\n",
      "Incidentally, if you think that only \"the left\" shuts down debate, then why is it that mainstream media never discusses prominent left-wing ideas like nationalisation, except to shut it down by saying how unrealistic it is? Writing off left-wing ideas as \"fringe\", \"radical\" or \"extreme\" has been a tactic of the right for decades.\n",

      "\n",
      "The abridged version is that when Malone was a graduate student in biology in the late 1980s at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, he injected genetic material—DNA and RNA—into the cells of mice in hopes of creating a new kind of vaccine. He was the first author on a 1989 paper demonstrating how RNA could be delivered into cells using lipids, which are basically tiny globules of fat, and a co-author on a 1990 **SCIENCE** paper showing that if you inject pure RNA or DNA into mouse muscle cells, it can lead to the transcription of new proteins. If the same approach worked for human cells, the latter paper said in its conclusion, this technology “may provide alternative approaches to vaccine development.” \n",
      "These two studies do indeed represent seminal work in the field of gene transfer, according to Rein Verbeke, a postdoctoral fellow at Ghent University, in Belgium, and the lead author of a 2019 history of mRNA-vaccine development. (Indeed, Malone’s studies are the first two references in Verbeke’s paper, out of 224 in total.) Verbeke told me he believes that Malone and his co-authors “sparked for the first time the hope that mRNA could have potential as a new drug class,” though he also notes that “the achievement of the mRNA vaccines of today is the accomplishment of a lot of collaborative efforts.”\n",

      "i'm not up on this particular controversy, but I think Joe Rogan who I've watched a few times has struck me as a really brilliant interviwer. He may not be right about everything, he may have a guest that some people despise, but he strikes me as intellectually honest and open to being mistaken. I think he got to where he got to because he was willing to chat to all sorts of people, he's certainly no shock jock and he's not some total jerk like Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh or Hannity or any of those other cretins. I don't think he deserves such a massive pile-on, because in a time of pandemic you want people willing to ask questions, for example everyone tried to say in the first year of the pandemic that saying that Covid was a lab leak was tantamount to being a total loony, but we heard this year that Jeremy Farrar (director of the Wellcome Trust and a scientist) thought in private emails that the virus being a lab leak was 70/30 to it being from the wet market. But a few weeks later he signed a letter to the Lancet saying that anyone who doubted the market story was a conspiracy theorist. In the initial email he was worried about the lab leak theory because it 'might harm **SCIENCE**'. So there are questions to be answered. I'm triple jabbed so i'm absolutely not anti-vax in any way but I don't agree with this pile-on on Joe Rogan who strikes me as a pretty impressive person. Neil Young is free to do what he likes it doesn't mean he's understood every nuance of this particular issue as well any more than Rogan.\n",

      "But the problem is no-one has unfettered access to the truth. We are all making best guesses based on partial data. I agree that we can make judgements about likelihoods, and in some cases be highly confident that a particular statement is true (say human activity is warming the planet or whatever). But you hardly need to be a historian to know history is absolutely littered with people, whole societies, who all believed a certain thing, who would have considered that thing a stone cold fact, and yet we know (as far as we can) that they were wrong. I bloody love **SCIENCE**. I am a trained physicist. I love Bayes. I despair of the conspiratorial mode of much thinking these days. But I am very skeptical that the way to fight it is by deplatforming speech. I know Rogan does not have a 'right' to that platform. But still, I think any attack on the pipes of information, rather than the information itself, will likely backfire.I reckon the only way to fight is to educate - not just formally, but informally, in every conversation, tweet, CiF comment: try to show you have weighed up an argument, that you have not just ad hominemed it or straw-manned it, try to understand why someone might think something different from you without impugning their integrity, try to employ a scout mindset, and all that done, lay out as clearly as you can why you believe whatever you believe. \n",

      "That may have been the case then but it's not the case now. With modern **SCIENCE** the chances of the whole of society believing something that is wrong in an important way is tiny. Moreover the problem with those beliefs is not the holding of them in itself, it is the fact that major damage was caused to those societies by actions taken based on those beliefs being true. On matters of fact, there is nothing that we could plausibly be wrong about enough to cause major damage to society. \n",
      "This practical argument for free speech, that it allows society to work through ideas and that preventing it prevents potentially dangerous erroneous beliefs being cast aside also has to be weighed against deliberately malicious actors causing damage by spreading misinformation, as we saw over the last thirty years with the climate change debate. Freely allowing climate **SCIENCE** deniers access to media platforms did nothing to advance public knowledge and debate.

Then find the very few episodes since then with (even those with his more normal guests) where he doesn't go on a lengthy rant about masks or vaccines or ivermectin while his guests sit there either cowed into nodding their agreement because they know he'll have a go at them if they disagree or embarrassedly trying to segue into another subject. Practically every single episode has turned into a Covid rant about supposed personal freedoms in which he's on the wrong (and he's, he's wrong) side of both the **SCIENCE** and public health policy - he makes the classic libertarian error of thinking that freedom equates to a right to be utterly and completely selfish.
