      "\"...In the UK decisions as to vaccine testing and approval can only be based upon the advice of an independent regulator\"\n",
      "There is a specific difficulty in the UK in that the Government is led and directed and controlled by a man widely reputed to be a proven liar, deceptor, dissembler, and a ruthless self promoter. The concepts of 'independent' within a administration with apparent totalitarian aspirations - illegally proroguing Parliament, criminal immunity for state officials, attacks on the judiciary, are somewhat tenuous. When there is a prospect of Mr Johnson seeing a personal political advantage to prursue a course of action, it can be expected that 'independent' authorities will comply or be dissolved (rather like the HSE). \n",
      "The BBC itself is now widely seen as a mere agent of government 'messaging', serving the interests of The Party. The attempt to change lobby rules, to reward 'compliance' with preferred access means the independent media itself is perceived as a mere agency of the state. \n",
      "Then we must turn to the vaccine authorisation. The authorisation mechanism was invented in October 2020 with amendment to the Human Medicines Regulations 2012, to allow the MHRA to grant temporary authorisation of a covid-19 vaccine without needing to wait for the EMA. \n",
      "As the BMJ revealed, the \"MHRA has not published specific details about the approval process, but a spokesperson told The BMJ that scientists and clinicians had “carefully and scientifically reviewed the safety, quality, and effectiveness data—how [the vaccine] protects people from covid-19 and the level of protection it provides.\"\n",

      "We have still managed to offer the vaccine for free. My wife and I jumped at the chance and are grateful. Many of our friends and relations don't trust the vaccine. Even though, as the hardest hit country in the world, we all know people in our immediate circles who have died of Covid. Mistrust of government runs deep.\n",
      "But there is a deeper and more worrying factor. Mistrust of science. There are legitimate concerns that govt advice is not based on science. Certainly there is a media blackout on any discussion of the uncertainties in the science. Something that is intellectually unhealthy and smacks of authoritarianism if not worse.\n",
      "India has achieved significant progress against covid by using a treatment that you cannot mention by name on social media without your post being deleted. The censorship even extends to top scientists reporting their peer reviewed research. Even the inventor of mRNA vaccines has had his posts deleted.\n",
      "Trust works both ways. The people won't trust govt if govt won't trust the people. When govt is as untrustworthy as ours is in Peru it's fair to put the argument that trusting the govt is the bigger risk. Peru's record on the forcible sterilization of Indian women is recent and horrific. \n",

The only place to turn for direction and assurance was our governments, especially as the scientists honestly answered most of the questions we had - \"we don't know yet\". \n",
      "But we needed to know, to have answers in order to keep ourselves, our families, our communities safe.

      "From the beginning, there has been inadequate and contradictory messaging from all sides. Self-promoting hustlers were to be expected: political leaders have no excuse, particularly when their extensive pandemic emergency plans specifically state how vital it is that messaging not be screwed up.\n",
      "Looking back, it seems clear how much of the public's initial experience with Covid-19 has morphed into hesitancy about the vaccine and caution about actions currently being taken.\n",
      "Not talking about the lunatic fringe, the anti-establishment protesters, the religious extremists, but us, the general public - who behave responsibly, get vaccinated, but still feel unsure.\n",

      "I had my two jabs because I considered it to be in my best interests, but also as playing my part as a member of wider society.Things have not always been so clear-cut. Following Andrew Wakefield's claims, my wife and I were unsure whether or not the MMR jab that our child was due to have was safe. Could we have the three jabs separately NO, the NHS was all or nothing. Would anyone deal credibly with Wakefield's claims - NO. He was decried as a charlatan and an idiot, but then so was Barry Marshall who later gained a Nobel prize for identifying Heliobacter pylori as the cause of peptic ulcers. Fortunately for us, a friend with a baby born soon after ours was a former nurse married to a senior doctor - their belief in herd immunity (their words) and walking the walk gave us the confidence that wasn't coming from ministers or the NHS.Are all of the vaccine-hesitant stupid? Well, apparently the highest concentration of the vaccine-hesitant in the US is among those with a PhD. Now, Linus Pauling had two Nobel prizes when he persuaded his wife to ignore oncologists and take very high doses of vitamin C - he was partly right, she became entirely dead.Trust is earned and as Chris Whitty (alone) seems well aware, altruism and goodwill are limited in even the most compliant populations. Developing vaccines requires hard science, living with a novel endemic virus in our midst requires the ability to engage with hearts and minds - and not to screw things up by being caught with your pants down, breaking your own rules.\n",

I gave respect and watched the whole thing, must have been 45-60 minutes. The whole thing was riven with misspelled and \"misgrammared\" text, and this is usually enough to dismiss anything, in my book. However, there was one absolutely glaring misrepresentation of science which really wound me up. The DVD alleged that the two chunks of building which broke off at the top simultaneously should have landed at the same time according to physics, but they didn't, however slight the difference. Now, I paid attention at school and I liked physics, and the sheer fact that this organisation of goons could co-opt \"science\" to speak for them and few to no one could discern that either they lied through their teeth or they were massive idiots, the sheer fact of this should gall everyone.\n",

      "The delta variant is more infectious than the original variant of SARS-Cov 2. Vaccines are very effective against the original but much less effective against the delta variant. Therefore, vaccinated people who become infected and spread the infection are creating selective pressure in favour of the delta variant.\n",
      "All that is true, but that doesn't mean they are making it worse. They are not. The delta variant would have become the dominant variant anyway, with or without vaccines, because it is more infectious. Vaccination may be speeding up the process of it becoming dominant, but it is doing so by reducing non-delta infections, not by increasing delta infections. And that is what matters, the total number of infections, not what proportion are of which type.\n",
      "Is it better to have a million infections, half a million each of the delta and original variants, or half a million infections, of which 450,000 are delta and only 50,000 are not delta? In the latter case, delta is much more dominant, but that doesn't make it the worse scenario.\n",
      "The only scenario in which vaccination would be worse is if infection by the original strain conferred better immunity against the delta variant than was conferred by the vaccine. There is not a shred of evidence that this is the case.\n",

      "My trust in the health services, in health data gathering (e.g. Johns Hopkins University), and in health bodies across the world from Fauci's CDC to the UK's SAGE is quite independent of my utter distrust for the slovenly despot and his cabinet of goons. In fact, when we saw huge majorities across the country supporting a continued mask mandate, while government repealed it, it is quite clear that a lot of people do NOT trust the government on this massive issue.

Indeed compared with other vaccine programmes it has exceeded expert forecasts.Younger people are now coming forward but many may have been inadvertently given the impression that they were not at risk by the initial concentration on the older age groups. Whilst they remain much less at risk there is a growing realisation that the level of risk means they should also get vaccinated without delay. \n",

It’s denial of this basic fact that makes me so cross with those opposed to vaccination. I am also sick of being told they have an immune system, yes those of us with compromised immune systems are more at risk of dying from covid, but most people who have died had perfectly functioning immune systems. If our immune system was sufficient, nobody would ever die of disease. I support Macron 100%. His job is to protect the people of country, not risk everyone’s lives for a selfish minority.

It is important to understand that anti-vaxxers are just another sub-set of the politically-extreme bunch of nutters and haters that deny all the evidence in favour of conspiracy theorists and other and attention seekers that flourish on social media and far-right media outlets. Those who follow these absurd \"causes\" are at the least frustrated by democratic systems that do not gives majority powers to their own minority viewpoints (as if those they favour actually want the responsibility of power) and are otherwise bitter at those who have made a better fist of their lives than they themselves have.\n",
      "The specific danger with anti-vaxxers is that they are effectively pro-Covid activists, as they prolong the duration of the pandemic with their opposition to the most effective anti-Covid weapon we have: vaccination.\n",

Because a thing like, say, masks providing an effective-enough dampener to virus spread, can and has been be shown in very plain and graphic forms to be the case. Plus, to argue for something like vaccination uptake and even passporting, you don't really have to say much more than - polio/ smallpox/ measles, it's just like that.What I find is a furious and hyper-complicated barrage of pseudo-intellectual gravel being chucked at these rather plain cause-and-effect operations, and at the data that show that, yes it happens, it happened, it is happening and it will happen. Arguments that present labyrinths of dead-end tunnels and require a lot of intellectual effort in the digging of them.That's why we end up with someone like Dr Didier Raoult, who discovered the first giant virus (the mimivirus I think it was called), and Cambridge-educated lawyers falling for this elaborate and exhausting anti-vaxx tripe.\n",

      "Of course every state is flawed but even wealthy countries have a surprising level of paranoia that leads to people who are anti-vaccine, anti-mask or anti-lockdown and, in some cases, all three. But it is as much an anti-science viewpoint as an anti-state one. \n",

      "It is very obvious that electric is the most eco-friendly option, that doesn't mean there aren't problems with it but technology usually moves forward out of necessity, it's why major wars result in rapid technological development. The issues are solved because the technology becomes widely used and there's an advantage in improving it, if the basic technology is not used then little or no work goes into improving it.The idea that there's no advantage to more eco friendly technology is one of the new tricks of climate **DENIAL**ism, \" it doesn't work\", \" it's not perfect\", \"there's some <insert problem> with it that means you should just stick with fossil fuels\"\n",
