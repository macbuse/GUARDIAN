      "Referring to HMG and its advisors, you say they were:\n",
      "Right on vaccine development: not sure what is meant by this but it's perhaps trivially true. Surely all governments from the start of the government would be in favour of the rapid development of safe effective vaccines.\n",
      "Right on its deployment compared to the EU: I disagree. EU27 is now at a similar level of vaccination to UK. There was a period of a month or two where, due to Astra Zeneca contract breach, EU vaccine procurement/deployment looked dire compared to UK. But, due to HMG incompetence in late 2020, UK remained in quasi-lockdown longer than most EU MSs. EU took quick action to remedy supply issues and EU stocks of mRNA vaccines (safer and more effective) are plentiful compared to UK whose supplies look decidedly shaky. EU has also contributed more than UK per capita to Covax which is good for EU and good for the world (including UK).\n",
      "Correct on who should be vaccinated first: yes but again probably trivially true. Very few countries have departed significantly from WHO's recommended order of vaccine priority and those that did eg New Zealand had very specific reasons.\n",
      "Correct on spacing out the timing of vaccines: UK was forced to delay second doses of both types of vaccine due to rampant Alpha (arguably caused by HMG incompetence in late 2020) so this is not really a decision HMG can take credit for. There is some evidence that OAZ protection is stronger with a longer gap between doses so HMG got lucky there. I’ve yet to see any evidence that protection from mRNA vaccines is stronger with a longer gao and have seen much that says it is weaker. One could view the JCVI's recent advice to reduce the gap from 12 to 8 weeks as a partial climbdown - an admission the initial policy to extend the gap was perhaps not the optimal one (and certainly not against the Delta).\n",
      "Correct on unlocking (as case numbers show): As I recall, advisers advised AGAINST the May unlocking and government did it anyway. UK case numbers are amongst the highest in the world; my understanding is that most experts believe HMG was wrong on unlocking in May, and should have left at least some NPIs in place after Step 4. I personally would like HMG to aim for something better than very high but stable case numbers, or very high case numbers going down a little bit. Another worrying aspect of the UK’s full unlocking is the removal of a lot of the incentive among the unvaccinated younger population to get vaccinated.\n",
      "“Based on their track record I think that they can be trusted on whether it should be given to children”… it says in the article the MHRA has advised that the benefits (of Pfizer for adolescents) far outweigh any risk.\n",
      "Are you seriously saying that based on HMG's track record, they can be trusted? I am struggling to think of anything, Covid or otherwise, in the current government's track record, that gives me any confidence whatsoever that they can be trusted on anything.\n",

      "Yet again another vaccination discussion, which no doubt will descend into the realms of fantasy. Firstly let me lay out the facts that mainstream media has at least 1 board member belonging to big pharma, therefore controlling content and promoting whatever propaganda they wish, while suppressing any opposition. As has been noted by the comments made about anti-vaxxers and the removal of content from media platforms that do not conform to their view. This is an affront to free speech and has the hallmarks of dictatorship. What is needed is total transparency from the government, from science and from the media, unfortunately, this has not been the case. Yes, the government and science have been reading from the same page, though far too many times has this been an about-turn, creating doubt and mistrust in what we are told. Today it was reported that 55% of people in hospitals are unvaccinated, though a further 34.9% of people in hospitals are double vaccinated. Can you understand peoples mistrust when we are constantly fed mixed messages by the media by the government and by science? How can you have complete trust in a system that wants to vaccinate children when we honestly do not trust the system ourselves, if we did then you wouldn't have such a divide in society between those who are vaccinated and those who are not. This is not just a dilemma of British society but this is the dilemma of a world population. I am not trying to create a negative attitude, but instead to level the playing field where open and honest discussion can have sense over the scaremongering tactics of the media.\n",

      "Perhaps they are mindful of the SAGE report the government published last Friday 15 mins before recess.\n",
      "It's quite clear that whilst vaccines are 'safe and effective' on an individual basis - the strategy of deployment whilst infections are high, particularly as transmission and infections can still occur with these drugs - endangers the whole vaccine programme and the population, by increasing viral fitness and resistance.\n",
      "It may take decades to perfect a vaccine to eradicate this virus, therefore it is incumbent on all of us to minimise cases until we do. The array of complex, debilitating and deadly complications arising from infection impacting many vital systems are frightening. Scientists need time to do their work and we have to protect each other until they do.\n",

I guess they are losing out and can’t do the things they’ve been accustomed to - but their impatience and selfishness risks everything. \n",

I get how you feel - I do too - but the simple fact is we didn't get it right - infections persisted and we didn't identify where or how to stop them.\n",
      "It only takes one case.\n",
      "Infections persisted primarily in hospital and care settings with transient HCW the greatest spreaders. The NHS should never have been exposed to this pathogen - its infection control record with HAI's was crap before the pandemic. We expected our doctors and nurses to cope with substandard PPE when the same virus attracts full biosafety precautions in a BSL-4 laboratory. That was criminal neglect and gross stupidity.\n",
      "I've argued since the start of the pandemic for restoration of our infectious disease and isolation hospitals - keeping Covid away from the NHS general network. Japan announced this week that Covid infections will now be treated at home - not hospital - with medical teams in full biosafety equipment. That will help too.\n",
      "But none of that is possible whilst infections still circulate - that's the one clear lesson we learnt.\n",

      "I'm cynical enough to wonder whether the delay in vaccinating those over 10 is because the only approved vaccine for them is the Pfizer. \n",
      "That's a more expensive vaccine than the Astra Zenica one - this government is reluctant to fund proper healthcare. \n",
      "Pfizer also presents significant resources and management difficulties (the vaccine has to be stored at very low temperatures in special-purpose fridges and used within a comparatively short time of being taken out of its fridge). \n",
      "GP surgeries and community pharmacies don't own the low temperature fridges that'll be needed to store the Pfizer vaccine. The under 30s as a whole can't access private transport - and many vaccination centres (especially those offering Pfizer) can't be accessed safely, easily or at all by public transport. \n",
      "These difficulties are - probably - manageable if there's sufficient will to do so. For example, maybe mobile vaccination vans can be equipped with low temperature fridges and sent to the children's neighbourhoods.

That has not been the case and people are perfectly entitled to form their own opinions even in the absence of clear, cogent, correct advice.\n",
      "I'm not vaccinated by choice. I don't doubt they are 'safe and effective' on an individual level at preventing disease progression from first exposure and with minimal serious effects - but I seriously question the strategy of deploying these vaccines when they are non-sterilising agents that do not prevent infection or transmission at a time of high prevalence. \n",
      "We have created the perfect circumstances for vaccine escape and an increase in viral fitness - with potentially grave and refractory consequences for the entire programme. \n",

      "Fifteen months ago the obsession in governmental circles was about hand washings and sanitisers. Shops even had people at the doors - maskless - squirting the stuff onto people's hands as they entered. Yet Covid was always known to be a respiratory infection, with airborne transmission, yet there was little pressure to insist on facemasks. Very different in the Far East, in countries who had experienced SARS fifteen years ago. The earliest pictures from Korea and Taiwan showed almost universal mask-wearing\n",

Since then her entire family has had it, going down like dominoes one after the other, her stepdad (double vaccinated, no underlying health conditions) is now on oxygen in hospital and her mum (also double vaccinated) is still not over it, struggling with fatigue and barely holding it all together. The latest news is that my 2 year old nephew has tested positive today. By the way, this isn't the point for an anti-vaxxer to chime in with bollocks about the vaccine not working - I dread to think how much more ill they'd be if not for the vaccine. If my niece had been vaccinated it would have reduced the chance of her catching it and reduced the chance of her transmitting it if she had caught it. Vaccinating 12 to 15 year olds will help prevent it ripping through - and no, I don't think that's inappropriately dramatic language - countless other families, and can't come quickly enough.\n",

Any ill health due to the vaccine will generate far more publicity and anxiety than ill health due to the virus particularly if it's ill health in children. That's just the nature of the media and human nature. A single child becoming ill due to a vaccine side effect such as a blood clot even if it's 1 in a million will generate so much negative media coverage that it could impact the campaign to get adults vaccinated.

The data is a few weeks out of date, but extrapolating to estimate current levels, over 75% of 16 year olds and almost 90% of 17 year olds are likely positive from previous infection. As far as I am aware there is no equivalent data for under 16s. Best guess is that under 16s also have high seropositivity levels but likely to be lower with lower ages. This means that a significant portion of the consequences of not vaccinating children have already happened. It should therefore be possible to actually quantifiably see how significant the effects have been in children rather than speculate.

      "For another thing, Starmer inherited a party that was not just reeling from its worst electoral performance in eons, but which was also internally and antagonistically riven--not a strong hand to try and play when you've just come into the game.\n",

      "Starmers main problem is that he is seen as a career politician. He does not seem to have any core principles or convictions. This leads to him being unable to clearly communicate his vision of what he wants to do. Then his reliance on focus groups and latching on to things like flag-waving just make him look like a chancer who will say anything to get a vote. Personally he is boring and dull which does not help.Also the Tories have had a year of daily briefings which they have used as political broadcasts, the press and media have given them an easy ride on their incompetence and Kier has failed to criticise them when he had the chance, with people saying you should not play politics in a pandemic. Yeah just imagine the Tory party, press and media if a Labour Government had done the exact same things at every step of the pandemic as this government. Would be a tirade of criticism and we know it.The final thing is amess said blatantly that tories favour their own constituencies when in government, this is corrupt but it is how they always operate and many towns and cities that did not get much benefit in the past have now thought well we'll see if we get anything by voting with them. I think they will end up disappointed but that is where we are.Given the pandemic will be here for a while , **VACC**ines are rolling out well and economic predictions are good, the tories will likely give a few sops to marginal seats hog the news bulletins and still be ahead at next GE.

      "Johnson, meanwhile, emboldened titanicallly by this outcome will press even harder now for Parliament to bin the FTPA. He will go to the country next year, either in the Spring or the Autumn. He can't afford to let the golden opportunity of the **VACC**ine 'bounce' and the sensation of liberation from lockdowns go to waste by leaving it any longer.

The next general election is years away, Labour have plenty of time to work on their messaging and Starmer to work on his bedside manner and relatability. But Labour HAVE to move back to the worries of white, middle aged Britons, the ones who turn out to vote. He needs to stop bashing the UK, he needs to automatically stop opposing every single thing the Tories do, and he needs to stop worrying about stuff most voters don't care very much about - Boris paying for renovation, asking for his nanny to be paid by supporters, etc. Yes, Boris is corrupt & he lies a lot - but most voters simply are not bothered.

There's nowhere for them to go without a complete rebrand. They can't move to a more socially right-wing position as young people will desert them for the greens. They can't move further economically left-wing as the government is already paying the salaries of half the country (there's very little space to go) and whilst the policies themselves are popular, the public don't trust them to deliver them. Brexit haunts them; traditional 'red-wall' voters still mostly back it, whereas their younger voters see it as a disaster. \n",
      "Starmer isn't great, sure, but you have to remember that Corbyn was utterly annihilated not very long ago. It's not a leadership issue, it's a combination of Labour's structural issues and the unfavourable time to be in opposition. The economy is rebounding, the **VACC**ine rollout (while not the government's doing) is going brilliantly and the public have faith that the world will still return to normal. During covid, any attack on the government was seen as petty, as the public seemed to believe the government were doing their best.

Although I would of liked Starmer to have been far more vocal during the past 14 months with regard not just to the pandemic response but for the chaos that is Brexit, the blatant dodgy contracts, the people forced to use food banks, children going hungry and not having the resources to study at home, changing laws/protecting statues, the atrocious 1% NHS pay rise, 50% cut to arts education, I do appreciate it was a difficult time to be the opposition when most people were focused on avoiding the virus and the tragic deaths of loved ones.

Or should that be without a first thought? For “Boris”, inept and mendacious as he is, has something going on. He’s got the **VACC**ination programme thanks to other’s effort of course, and he’s got brexit, which to judge from most of the press is the most bloody marvellous thing ever.

      "Predictable result given the high Brexit Party poll in 2019, not particularly a sign of further Tory Red Wall invasion, although Labour imagining that ' trendy' national themes and attacks on the Tories would cut it on the doorstep rather than practical attention to local issues is worrying for the future. Because of CoVid emergency suspension of normal politics, Brexit amnesia, and as yet incomplete policy revision, Labour won't mobilise massively at the moment and there was never a way UKIPpers were going to be rallied to it at the moment. Even without **VACC**ine bounce and demonstrable Brexit benefits the Tories will continue to harvest UKIP sentiment until Labour gets its act together, if it can. Reaching over the side to haul the 'culturally conservative' back in the boat threatens to capsize the lot, and for what. According to M Goodwin et al, impossible for Labour to appeal to metropolitan individualists and parochial communitarians at once (although Boris can appeal to each and everyone?) What's needed is a more nuanced and differentiated address, which speaks to communities in their own terms, as did not happen in Hartlepool. It's not all about policy.\n",

Boris is strong on narrative, weak on facts. Boris constantly pans out towards a larger feel good narrative in which the Brexit he delivered is allegedly helping the **VACC**ine rollout and Freeports. He also throws in other achievements.

But Starmer has a mountain to climb because of Jeremy Corbyn, the centre- hard left split in the party, a totally inadequate deputy leader, the fact that they are still, after all this time, sitting on the brexit fence and because the full effects of a disastrous decision to depart the EU hasn't hit home yet in places such as Hartlepool. Once all these things have bedded down, and austerity hits home in the northern blue line areas of the country, things will start to turn in Starmer's direction. The two factors which led to this big swing to the Tories in Hartlepool were both humongous errors of judgement by the people there. They will very quickly regret voting Tory.
