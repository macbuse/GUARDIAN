      "Very good piece: lots of correct analysis but very well expressed too. Ultimately, they don't care. \"Nothing will fundamentally change\". I live in another country but, looking on, I would've bet the house on Sinema and Manchin being the rotating villains to whom Biden could point and say: \"You all saw them: what could I do?\" and if I knew it, the Democratic Party knew it. There were many techniques at hand to bringing these clowns to heel but he kept treating them gingerly, allowing them to further gut his agenda, before they killed it stone dead. Biden seemingly would've taken anything, just for 'a win', something to hold up as a trophy. This man isn't serious nor is his cockamamie party. The Democratic Party would happily accept winning 2024 by a single vote, or Florida by a single vote, and because they'll be up against a swivel-eyed lunatic like Trump or Cruz or DeSantis and they have almost zero pressure to be anything more than slightly less awful than them, one shouldn't expect anything more of them. That's how this machine is built; that's the nub. When the Republicans slaughter them in the 2022 mid-terms, the Democrats will have even more excuses for not being able to do anything. \n",
      "Some debate is swirling around on whether Biden (or Harris) should be challenged in 2024 for the Democratic nomination. Biden's people are saying that he will run again but they have to say that or he'll be an even lamer duck. The main idea is that presidents can't be successfully challenged in this way (although Ronald \"Mad Dog\" (McDonald) \"Ray-Gun\" Reagan came close in 1976 with 47% of the Republican primary vote) so you try to leverage them left but we've seen this movie before. Biden was portrayed as the new FDR after he beat Sanders, with the help of Sanders megaphoning this fake news, before the \"pivot\" once the general arrives. You'd have the same pantomime in a Democratic primary and the news - rather than act as a check and balance, and asking why a whole load of voters were lied to - will cheer it on as being \"smart\" and \"savvy\". Someone like Marianne Williamson has a career outside of politics so she'd be able to burn her political bridges but she'd have to run hard and run to win, not for concessions which would then vanish. \n",
      "I don't see it working without third party leverage. You either run in the Democratic Party - for news media coverage - and then jump to the Greens or the People's Party for the general or you just run in the general. Taking 10 - 15% out of the Democrats' polling in the general and they have to come to you and bend the knee. Once you get the pledges in public and numerous times, then you agree to endorse in swing states and run hard in safe states to obtain 5% of the vote for matching federal funds next time. \n",
      "A time for some real bravery. There's not much to lose, though. The only mainstream Democrat who could possibly win would be Michelle Obama but she's zero interest. Should've listened to Benjamin Studebaker's left-wing case against voting for Biden. In a Trump second term, the Republicans would've been disembowelled and Trump would've been boxed-in, with everyone running out the clock. Now he'll be back in January 2025, running on full vengeance mode for all 48 months of score-settling.\n",

      "If anything, history from 1600s through to mid 1900s of Europe provides the context to what happens in the world today and explains a lot of what we see today. Capitalism is something that emerged and exploded during this period, with competing imperialist countries such as the UK, each seeking to colonise and exploit. Their leaders ie owners haven't dropped that culture, continue to use their power to dominate other countries wherever they can and exploit them with no regards for locals, and their lack of integrity extends right through most of their entire populations. They see themselves as entitled to own and use others, their land and their wealth. If something works for them, and generates wealth for they will do it. However wealth is a net zero factor. As they take, others lose. As they become rich others become poor. Eg India had 20% of world GDP before UK went there, but only 4% when UK left. Its not as if the UKs current position was created through some magic money tree. If Iraqis or Libyan workers have lost wealth, then others have gained, perhaps in the US, UK, and local Iraqi/Libyan despots. If US or UK oil companies have gained with access rights, or say UK mining company shares gain when they find reserves in western Africa, then locals lose their wealth. It happens right across the world though, and within countries too. If UK is seen as a single entity, then if London becomes rich, the North becomes poor. If manufacturing has declined, and the need for skilled workers has dropped through political decisions (note countries like Germany managed to maintain industrial manufacturing) then the locals are left to try to relocate, retrain, or, work in unskilled roles if they can find them..each time earning less and less. Working in call centres, ( remember they went to S Asia as it was cheap labour... ) , as courier, deliveroo or uber drivers delivering to people who have no disposable incomes is never going to be a substitute for those skilled jobs. Meanwhile those down South will get even richer, as they own the call centres, so feed off the cheap labour, made ever cheaper because its in abundance. The locals get to a point that resort to crime, drugs, and can't spend the time with children to educate them. A viscious cycle for them.They are the workers in need and they need an equal platform with local involvement and investment. That equality comes from political decisions.  If you step back from timescales, look at the big picture, holistically and globally, the same applies today as it did then, and did over the centuries before too. Different time, different stages, same scenarios, same actors.\n",

      "Europe may before long be cast adrift by a US Administration. This is what China and particularly Russia bank upon. And Vladimir Putin is testing out before our eyes. He feels what in Russian chess is called by the German words Zugzwang and Zeitnot, owing to his age and Russia's economic and demographic decline. Ukraine is not the prize, but the epitome of the conflict. Ideal, because it gets no NATO guarantees. Ideal, because Russian pressure leads to Western assistance, which Putin can then again adduce as proof that NATO is reaching out to Kyiv and the River Don on Russia's heartland. Ideal because the Ukrainian test will spell out further moves in the Baltic, against Finland and Sweden and NATO's northern flank in Norway. It's a short drive from Kirkenes to Murmansk, and vice versa.\n",

      "The European Union is a political and military lightweight, in spite of vast, increasingly well-equipped and trained armies. There is no command centre. Whereas Russia is, pro temp, commanded from one single centre, as isolated we hear as Stalin's ever was, minus the alcohol. And the Russian military have recovered from the decay of the 1990s. Attacking Kyiv frontally from Belarus would be a piece of cake. Occupying it might be another story. Recall Stalin's city on the Volga.\n",

      "It was always going to be very difficult. As has been stated so often, the GOP have major natural advantages, in that they won big in 2010 at state legislature level, allowing them to gerrymander congressional districts, and they also have most of the thinly populated 'flyover' states (some of which were compared to rotten boroughs in the late nineteenth century).\n",
      "Nor was that all. The Democrats have almost always had difficulties with party discipline, because they cover the arc between the centre right and the left. The difficulties are not as severe as they were until the extinction of the standard issue 'southern Democrat', but they are still there, and with the country so finely split, that gives enormous bargaining power to the centre right of the party.\n",
      "Some of it is self-inflicted. Biden is a Delaware Democrat and has spent a legislative lifetime at the beck and call of the corporate class. He was the tribune and placeman of the Wall Street interest within the party. The infrastructure deal was permitted to be as big as it was chiefly because it would secure good revenue streams for the corporate class. The left suffered a massive defeat in the 2020 primaries, so their backing of the WH will always be contingent, and grudging.\n",
      "Biden is not going to throw over the habits of a lifetime (any more than Johnson). The only way the Democrats will win a sufficient section of what was once their core vote - the post-industrial working and lower middle classes - is if they deliver inflation-beating wage rises. Unfortunately, the odds are stacked heavily against that, and probably would have been even with a Sanders presidency.\n",

Only Russians with foreign connections can even enjoy the luxury of having a visa bank card. For its part, the EU doesn’t so much drag up new member countries as coax them into an exclusive rich-boys club in which their efforts then get co-opted into the service of an ever more ambitious European project – and this has the obvious negative side effect of alienating and isolating Russia even further. \n",

Sadly, the fact that cannot be overlooked is that he was only given a theoretical half share of the Senate seats, and a slightly more generous margin in the house. Having no mandate in the Senate has pretty much hogtied the Democrats, given the partisan nature of Moscow Mitch's republiKlan party. Listening to commenters complaining that 'they're' getting nothing done when the main obstacle is a silver grey creature that rules American politics from a minority position seems just a tad rich. Check for yourselves when the last time was that the party of Q-believers won a majority by popular vote, and that's not the college. Even some of us Brits have begun noticing how broken American politics has become, until it is fixed expect matters to become far worse. In the meanwhile, good news for the Jan 6th committee, 'free' access to TFG's records concerning the terrorist attack on the Capitol last year has been granted.

      "Senators Manchin and Sinema have both stood against elements they don't believe in and effectively put an end to a badly thought out bill and the laughable attempt to remove the filibuster.\n",
      " Why so many democrats think/feel they should have voted for something they didn't believe in is beyond me. Both Senators and Members of Congress are voted for by the people as individuals, not just as a Democrat or Republican and are entitled to vote the way their conscience leads them.\n",
