      "The “greed is good” mantra has encouraged the off-shoring of our industries and jobs at great cost to the Western World and all because a small wealthy elite has put their own interests ahead of the common good. Now look where we find ourselves. \n",
      "Capitalism is a system, like any, that can be changed to suit the interests of its practitioners if, and when, they realize the need to do so. This is not beyond the realm of possibility in western democracies if they can deal with the vested interests that have largely captured it in our time.\n",
      "In any form of a free enterprise capitalist economy wealth will inevitably accrue upwards towards those with the resources to capture it and this process has only been accelerated by globalisation. This extraction of wealth from western nations is weakening them and undermining democracy to the comfort of those many authoritarian regimes who now openly challenge and reject such tried and tested pillars of democracy as the rule of law.\n",
      "Our political parties have been following the same neoliberalist trajectory for the last fifty years and where has it got us? We have blindly off-shored our industries, jobs and much of the wealth of our respective nations in the interests of the wealthy few. As industries and jobs have left our shores an increasing tax burden has fallen on the shoulders of those small businesses and workers who are still producing. Workers experience this as a reduction in wages and conditions and the community experiences this as a reduction in public spending on benefits and services.\n",
      "As long as wealth accrues upwards towards the wealthy elite, through the mechanism of globalization and its’ off-shoring of industries and jobs, and through the continual use of political influence by this elite to ensure they pay little or no taxes then western nations will decline. When wealth is extracted from the economy through the loss of industries and their jobs, and through tax policies favouring big business, then the flow of goods and services declines as more people become dependent on low-income jobs or welfare. \n",
      "For evidence of where this will lead us, just look at what happened on January 6 when those vested interests realised their man was going to lose office. That is why sensible governments must develop feedback mechanisms to deal with this tendency towards the concentration of wealth and its extraction from the economy. Because along with this concentration of wealth goes the concentration of political power in the hands of the few who are then tempted to use it to further their own interests.\n",
      "The extent of the extraction of wealth from the US alone is truly staggering, “In the past four decades—under Democrats and Republicans alike—$50 trillion has moved from the bottom 90 percent to the top 1 percent of Americans.”https://thebulwark.com/fifty-trillion-reasons-why/\n",
      "“And while this was happening, America’s middle class—the wonder of the world—was decimated. Two generations have grown to adulthood not even knowing what “middle class” means. Those generations have no conception of a time when factory workers could afford to own a home, two cars, send their kids to college, pay their medical bills, take a vacation, retire with dignity. What was once a normal and basic reality now seems like fantasy to people who have grown up in a work environment where the minimum wage today has half the buying power it did in 1968.”https://thebulwark.com/fifty-trillion-reasons-why/\n",
      "Fewer tax paying workers and with big business paying little or no tax weakens western democracy and all it represents in this world. We see this at work in the Chinese who believe the US has been seriously and permanently weakened by the global financial crisis because, the fact is, that crisis has put China in a stronger economic and strategic position than the US. We see this strategic edge in the superiority of China over the US emerging in areas like AI, Quantum Computing and Hypervelocity missile technology where China has the resources to pursue these areas and the cash strapped US does not.\n",
      "The only way forward for the US and the Western World is to now increase its spending on infrastructure which includes everything from education to defence. To do so will require the raising of corporate taxes to the same levels as they were in the post war period when the West was at the leading edge of global civilisation.\n",
      "Western democracies must change course or we will only impoverish ourselves and all that we stand for. Those inspiring values of human rights, rule of law and progressive thinking that have guided the development of our civilisation will be rejected by humanity if it does not see them as a path towards a better life.\n",

      "This is a powerful article by Ms Solnit; the thrust of it, that societal change and progress happen both quietly and dramatically, resonates with my observations over the 57-odd years of my life. A few examples:When I was born (in Australia) indigenous people were not counted as citizens, instead defined as 'fauna'. This changed dramatically in a 1967 referendum (one of the few to have ever been carried in Australia) where the majority of Australians voted for Aboriginal people to be full citizens. Aboriginal traditional culture was seen as 'backward' or 'stone age' but is now celebrated by the majority of Australians. Further, the recognition of the violence and injustice against Aboriginal people that arrived with white colonisation is now a mainstream social endeavor.When I was born the state determined a narrow set of grounds for divorce with documentary proof of such things as adultery, drunkenness and desertion leading in many cases to gross intrusions on the privacy of individuals. This was overturned in 1975 by 'no-fault divorce' law where the parties were seen as equal and could divorce by mutual agreement. A Family Court was also established to rule on cases where mutual agreement could not be reached.When I was born, all Australian States except Queensland still used capital punishment. The last execution was in 1968 in Victoria. From 1968 until 1985 each of the states progressively removed capital punishment from their books, and in 2010 the Federal Government made it illegal for any state to reimpose it. Further, it is illegal to extradite a prisoner in Australia to a jurisdiction where capital punishment is legal. When I was born, homosexuality was illegal in all states in Australia with heavy penalties including lengthy prison sentences. The states gradually decriminalised it over the intervening years. In 1994 the federal Labor Govt introduced anti-discrimination legislation; in 2017 a majority of Australians (61.6 per cent) in a plebiscite to legalise same sex marriage.When I was born, the ownership and use of firearms was very widespread and poorly regulated in Australia. In New South Wales for instance essentially anyone over 18 could purchase and use a rifle (including semi-automatic). No license or registration was required. In 1996 after the worst mass shooting in Australia's history (35 people killed in one incident), the Federal govt led the states in enacting powerful firearms laws that removed thousands of guns from the community, proper licensing and registration regimes and the need for individuals (eg. pastoralists) to prove a genuine need to own firearms. There have been no mass shootings in Australia since. In a recent Essential poll, 6% of Australians thought the laws were \"too strong\", 40% thought \"about right\" and 45% thought \"not strong enough\"The 'river' analogy in the article is terrific and rhymes very well with my understanding of the world as I have observed it over the last half century or so. I fully agree that this river cannot be stopped no matter how much a very few powerful and not-so-powerful people would like to go back to a world that is no longer and will never again exist.\n",

      "I do have to say I find this article to be a bit naive as far as truly understanding the underlying issues of what America is dealing with. In my heart I feel that too many people-both left and right have simply lost respect and common decency towards each other. I suppose personally My inner moto is that if I meet someone who is different from me-I may not agree with them but I will treat them first as a fellow human being-and I will try hard to see their point of view.I in no way support racism. And NO I did not vote for DT. Somehow though being White and identifying as white has become a bad thing. I cannot even write the very atrocious attacks that I have endured just because I am White. A lot of anger from the left against me for reasons I will never understand. And my politics are kind of both left and right. As a Conservative who values Freedom in the USA-I am still very deeply troubled by the crime waves and sudden openness to try to legalize as many drugs as possible. All while our Country is dealing with a huge gap between those who are educated and those who are not. If we legalize drugs in America I see all hell breaking loose. I truly do. I feel as if I am watching My Country landslide down into a major mess. It's not about race or ethnicity. For me it is about the Values our Country is built on. I have been the target of a Lot of attacks on me by a certain ethnic group. It's bizarre because they will tell me that I have to Move. I have to go away. I don't belong. And Yes, I was here first. As a Disabled person who has extra difficulties with everything- becoming a target and having to fend for my survival by a lot of disrespectful people who really do not care about how hard-- truly truly hard my life is--I don't understand why I have to fear them? And My Heart hurts for Race relations in our Country. I am mostly in the middle. Singled out for not belonging and then picked on. So, this article to me doesn't examine the fundamental problems we are facing which is that there are groups now who want to roll on over the Gentle, the Meek, the Weary, the Disabled and the beaten down. And in my opinion, it's really got to do with respect for the common man and woman going by the wayside. Respect disintegrating into a yell and a disregard for simple Common decency. Then again, I am proud of my morals. And I was raised in probably what would be classified as a Pro-Communist on one side and the other Parent clinging to Catholicism and trying so very hard to instill a great sense of Moral dignity and sense of Right and wrong in her children. I feel like in many ways my grandparents and my mom raised me. While I endured the other leftist side as best as I could. It is VERY difficult as a child to want to put up a Christmas tree bc that was what we were raised with only to suddenly be given a book entitled, \"The House without a Christmas Tree\"-and by the way noone had died-but made to grieve and being shunned for loving and enjoying Christmas. I have no idea how my Mom made it so long. And she was the minority. So you see, it's not really about Race. This all goes much deeper.\n",

      "You are in danger of proving his point, not answering it, by claiming the relative moral high ground for your politics and diminishing the moral value of those who hold different views.\n",
      "Your basic starting point “people can be divided into two broad groups” is a perspective that comes from seeing the world as divided into us-es and thems. Your categorisation of right wing values seems a bit negatively biased; your definition of socialism maybe over-generous. (Socialism in the proper sense of the word is not a vague concept of working together but the collective ownership of the means of production - and no major nation has gone far done this route and not turned back). \n",
      "I could for example reverse your argument by pointing out the downsides of planned economies and saying a majority of people believe in some form of market economy and only a minority believe in state planning and control - hence the majority of folk and nearly all nations are inherently right wing, not inherently left wing. But that would, in my opinion, be equally barking up the wrong tree. \n",
      "For me, answer to the question “why do we find it hard to recognise our common humanity” lies in psychology not politics. We are evolutionary designed to exist in small highly-collaborative groups and to be suspicious, even hostile, towards outsiders to that group. The tipping point for group size is speculated to be 75-150 (this fits with where chimpanzee groups break down) ie a group size where we can actively socialise and see the body language, facial signals etc of all our fellow group members. Ie we are collaborators with this we know and understand and agitators with those we don’t. \n",
      "The question, for me, in improving humanity’s lot is more a question of how we find ways to work together with our many different experiences and views when our species has ballooned to billions and technology has taken us global, than splitting into ideological groups and pointing at each other on social media. In a world beyond the social group ideology - in the form of religion or politics - takes the place of dialogue, interaction and understanding. Ever wondered where the terms “tribal politics” comes from? \n",

      "Next March I'll turn 86 years of age--I'm 5 years older than my favorite politician, Bernie Sanders, and decades older than my young heroes Greta Thunberg, Stacey Abrams, AOC, Rashida Tlaib, and (in our state legislature) Chris Rabb. I was lucky. Since my father, born in 1899 on an Iowa farm, became a reader of Muckraker books and a LaFollette Progressive in the 1910s and 20s, and remained one all his life, I was raised in a political household--and was begging my high school and town libraries to send off for books on the histories and cultures of Indigenous Americans, Black Americans, Africans and all those others whose lives we under-educated white children were able to read, at best, on about one page in our history books. Instead of those who left genuine legacies, our textbooks celebrated mythic, deliberately untrue or no longer important 19th century ideas that praised white male slaveholding traitors, robber barons, banksters and Manifest Destiny land-thieves. The librarians came through for me! At age fourteen, back in 1950, I got a head start, but when young people of any era hear and learn the truth and become able to recognize the real world, they rise out of the depths of naive ignorance into educated knowledge that leads directly to the only certainty--change! The important thing is whether that change will be good, or bad, or wallowing in the swamp of sentimental false permanence. When people see the badge I've worn every day since August 2014 (which I make on my button machine) that reads BLACK LIVES MATTER, dozens ask if I have any to give away--I usually do--while only one will try to insult me as a \"do-gooder\". I reply that I'm proud of trying to do good, when the only alternatives would be to do bad, or attempt the impossible--to do nothing, which always serves the bad. I live by the wisdom in Micah 6:8, which teaches me all I need to do: \"What does the Lord require of you, humanity, but to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.\" And I am sure that \"your\" God could have any name: Yahweh, Jehovah, Allah, Vishnu, Ahura Mazda, Inkulunkulu, Thunderbird, or simply your own ethical conscience.\n",

      "Unfortunately, I have to disagree. Every advance - for that is how I see the social and economic changes you list - is under attack. Right now, we have in the US a modest breathing space in which to gather our thoughts and marshall our forces, but it is hardly novel to observe that while some of us play by the rules of democracy and law, those who would turn the clock back will suffer no such constraints, as Trump's egregious administration proved over and over again - and continue to do so.\n",
      "I'm put in mind frequently by a social reading of Newton's third law: \"for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction\". Consider by way of an example the election of Obama to the office of US President. He himself has expressed the opinion that much of the extremist behaviour since was a reaction by the right to the affront of having a black man in the highest office in the land. The obdurate, indiscriminate opposition by Republican politicians to everything he proposed, everything he tried to do, every piece of legislation, every attempt to govern or find common ground, is testament to the 'opposite reaction', not to his political aims, but to the colour of his skin.\n",
      "And while the author limits her analysis to the US, on the global scale we only have to look at China, India, Poland, Hungary and Brazil (among others) to see the right's reaction after they lose a battle. For every step forward, the right will use rhetorical or literal force to push us two steps back; the undermining and eventual death of democracy is a profound case in point.\n",

      "Onward and upward...An effective opposition to exploitation, poverty, war and ecological ruin does not mean petitioning the owners and rulers of this society to pretend to be humane or to be more responsive to our needs. Capitalism always manages its managers - we need to stop being managed by them and start acting on the new terms that our times demand. All our large and small actions should aim at cutting the people who have power out of the picture, rendering them unable to act, and doing this in novel ways that can help to create a mass popular political reality that does not exist right now. We must use new forms of action that won’t produce quick results, but that can build toward something big in the future, as this social order declines, linked to similar efforts everywhere else in the world.\n",
      "The anti-wage labor direct action ethos that we need to create today is irreconcilably hostile to electoral politics. It involves sustained action in the workplace outside of and against the control of employers and unions. It means opposing all democratic, undemocratic, nationalist, racial or ethnic-based alternatives to a mass movement of the wage-earning class against capitalist social relations and the state. The best actions must have some potential to spread and become general, even if this potential to spread is solely in that they offer a strong example of what to try next.\n",

      "The problem is that the United States now has to confront its original sin: the enslavement of people of African descent. And, yes, I know that it was the colonists wot did it, but the Founding Fathers did virtually nothing to ameliorate the situation, and had no intention of abolishing slavery. It requires that the narrative of American history be re-written of which the 1619 Project is only a part. Many academic historians have been blazing this particular trail for a number of years, but only now is it entering the national bloodstream. And it's a narrative that doesn't reflect well on white Americans - we have, in no particular order, the massive exploitation of slave labor to drain, clear thousands of square miles of land (no, it wasn't the rugged pioneers who did it) across the American South and the Mississippi Valley along with the attendant brutalities and horrors of enslavement, the removal of the Cherokees and other indigenous peoples who were in the way - and then after the Civil War, the battle, which largely failed, over giving African-Americans even the most basic rights. So when you have to throw out the triumphalist Manifest Destiny narrative of white people creating the nation and replace with something that places the people who did the actual work i.e. the enslaved and the victims of this process i.e. the Native Americans, you're gonna get some blow back.\n",

      "Part of the problem is exactly the values the US was founded on - the real ones that can be seen in the history, not the 'creation myth' ones that were never enacted. I have worked on reservations in the USA, what a shock I got to see the USA's very own apartheid system - third world diseases, health care so starved of money that essential equipment was denied. I also found out that people were left to die on the street in winter (pick up what's left after the spring thaw), saw elderly roaming shopping malls in stinking, urine-soaked clothes, beggars everywhere. Every tribe I worked with had an horrendous history of invasion and dislocation. Eventually I went to DC, and took a look at the National Mall. I was astounded by the hypocrisy of the words written down at the monument. It's not hard to work out that the 'founding fathers' happily supported the brutal, systematic invasion, theft of lands and resources, murder and rape of indigenous peoples. Then there's what has happened as a result of slavery. I mean no offense and there are some wonderful people in the USA, but given the terrible actions that the powerful have consistently visited upon the powerless - it's no surprise that there will be a day of reckoning when the 'old guard' will be confronted with the past - the real past, not the fantasy of pilgrims and 'thanks giving'.\n",

Nothing to see here, everything is going to get better!Demographics aren't enough to assume the US works past it's explicitly racist and economically segregated society. The cult of Trump has subsumed the petite bourgeois faction of small and medium sized capitalists that have been simmering in eternal anger since the end of WW2, but now the watchword is \"immigration\" and \"CRT\" instead of \"communism\" and civil rights legislation. This country is always going to be critically wounded, socially and politically, both because it refuses to acknowledge the myths of it's own history, and the fact that it was the de facto penultimate colonial power after the second world war. If the ponzi scheme economy tilts just a little against the middle and working classes, which it will inevitably do, I expect a full reactionary backlash against any \"progressive\" tint this editorial author is squinting to perceive. In short, the left is going to get rinsed in 2022, and I predict a fully authoritarian executive to emerge in 2024, and last well into the next few decades.

      "I use the term meaning a world view that treats the market and capitalism not as a useful economic tool, but as something untouchable that is supposed to bring solutions in all kinds of areas. Capitalism not as a mere economic system but as a guiding principle for everything.I associate the term with a drive to privatize everything as well as confusing democracy with socialism. Everything is being called \"socialist\" even when it is just democratic common sense as soon as there is a role for the state in it. Not wanting to privatize infrastructure is not socialist.Similarly there is the idea that society doesn't exist as such, but that it is nothing but a collection of individuals. Which is true in a sense, but that it similar to saying a table doesn't exist as it is nothing but a collection of atoms. There is also the idea connected to it that there is no such thing as public service and that politicians are always only out for their own interest. Which is of course a perfect justification for corruption and goes hand in hand with the disdain for regulation. Of course criminals dislike regulation and red tape.In other words \"neoliberalism\" is denying the existence of a public sphere in the democratic sense as this view denies the very existence of a public as well as the idea of a \"public interest\". The \"state\" is seen as something alien and evil, best reduced to as small an existence as possible. This worldview is fundamentally anti-democratic in my opinion. There is complete lack of understanding that in a democracy the state is the political representation of the people. Maybe a different term would be better than \"neoliberalism\", the term doesn't matter as much. But these concepts are widespread, influential and - in my view at least - very damaging.\n",

      "It's quite true to say neoliberal is the most lazily applied epithet and all purpose insult of our age. Why can't people just call out rapacious capitalism for what it is rather than use a term that doesn't stand up to etymological scrutiny (i.e. it doesn't do what it says on the tin). There are plenty of rapacious capitalists about who claim to be both 'populists' and opponents of 'neo-liberal elites', from **TRUMP** downwards, and as a consequence they are given a free pass by people who are only too quick to point the finger at 'revisionists' like Macron and even Starmer. The fact that 'the (self appointed) left' waste so much energy on this rather than directly calling out the daily corruption and chicanery all around us is why they so rarely win elections, it's a form of collective narcissism that actually denies ordinary people the kind of social justice and equality of life chances and opportunities that they are crying out for now, not some hypothetical moment in the distant future when 'the left' has finally purged itself of all revisionist tendencies (i.e. never).\n",
