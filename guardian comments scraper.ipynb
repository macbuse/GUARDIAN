      "Nuances abound in any full understanding of the Pandemic, though most of the populace are not even willing to deal with hard and simple facts.  Certainly, the processing of a complete understanding is beyond the attention span and the desire of a good many, though perhaps not the readers here. If the Global Warming-Climate problems are not a good example of the difficulty of dealing with Scientific facts and Scientific limitations, nothing else can be seen as illustrating the problem more clearly: people prefer to assume that no harm can come to them or to minimize the difficulties.  The fact that this pattern, seen to be more applicable to adolescents than to adults- the ability to see risk as minimal and a life as more invulnerable in the face of such risks- that situation would seem to have ended. Most people out there are the nearly-immortal adolescents of their younger days.I have long suspected that Dr. Topol here is correct. As there is insufficient testing and tracing, it is impossible to make accurate assessments of asymptomatic disease. The Vanilla flavor of Covid19 had some possibly 80 % of cases as asymptomatic. This might not be the case if the Delta Variant is more severe in all and more dramatic in everybody. What might be the case however is that only 50 % are asymptomatic, or perhaps 30 % and this is yet significant enough from the standpoint of transmission. Those exposed to the 30 or 50 % or even fewer could spread to un-immunized and therefor unprotected individuals. Others could spread the virus as asymptomatic infections between multiple un-immunized or even among partially-immunized individuals. While all of this transmission is going on, a new Variant might then be able to assume some degree of prominence. The truth is that we do not know and we may not be absolutely blind, but we certainly are walking about with broken spectacles which distort our vision sufficiently to fail to account for a very chaotic and rapid change of circumstances with an evolving pathogen in multiple different forms. As we make assumptions to show what we know, or what we would hope to comfort those quite reasonably upset, we need to be careful. There are all too many out there who would deny all and are willing to use any errors to discredit the Science entirely.  Emergence of yet new episodes similar to Provincetown or to a new and more severe Variant may lead to loss of credibility and then to credulity among the masses and this will not help. There is a need for modesty in Science. It is always a process. The development of both tests and immunizations shows what it can do. The ability to fully prognosticate is not nearly something for which Science or the people who claim to use it can really solve so readily for the purpose of easy answers.  Pandemics do as they will. Humans can exhibit hubris, but the virus has control of the future for now and likely for some time to come and we have to muddle along with it as best as we can. Assuming that it will be done soon sounds good, but is probably incorrect, as much as I would hope that this would be the case.  If we are honest with ourselves, we need to hold on tightly and ride the business out and not get either complaisant or depressed and merely wait things out. In the UK plague moved about from 1346 and into the 1370's with periods of quiescence before it was done. It is true that antibiotics would have shortened the business, but irregular bursts at intervals, sometimes quite long, are far from unknown and antivirals may be out there for SARS-CoV-2. Even with that, we also need to develop ones that may be less prone to the development of resistance. HIV-AIDS is a quite different creature, but it shows that even a treatment may need to go through multiple changes to remain effective and reasonably successful.\n",

      "As an epidemiologist, I've often noted that data collection and reporting (& related public health strategies) are political. In much of Canada, data on age, ethnicity, race and precise locations of outbreaks were either deliberately not collected or suppressed, making it impossible for local governments, ethnic organizations and individuals to plan and act effectively. Why? Because governments were terrified of agism or racism or targeting specific localities AND such information would undermine the policy objectives of universal masking and social distancing. This has precedence: insisting, for example, that HIV was a threat to the entire population rather than to men who have sex with men was not only untrue but politically motivated. Likewise, \"second hand smoke\" was over-egged and weaponized to vilify smoking and smokers. Now data that would tell us how effective vaccines are deliberately not collected or suppressed out of fear that it will fuel vaccine hesitancy/opposition. The use of hospital and death data conveniently underplays covid in the population and in particular covid in the fully vaccinated population. This is essential if the objective is to \"open up\" the economy to commerce, get people back in restaurants and bars and have tourism and all the associated cash rolling again. If vaccines aren't hyped as a panacea, and the current outbreaks blamed on people who aren't immunized, the false and dangerous narrative of \"it's ok to socialize, travel, shop, etc.\" is exposed & it becomes obvious we should all be masking, socially isolating, and staying home. Which, of course, we should. If vaccines were so effective, we simply wouldn't see the number of cases of covid in the US and UK as we in fact do. Rates of infection this summer are higher than last well before immunization began. It isn't \"all down to vaccine hesitancy\"; that's propaganda plain and simple. Vaccines can and do reduce illness severity and that's important, but it isn't the only thing.\n",

      "Thanks. I take the point that you are making about the % of covid deaths in the vaccinated group being higher from raw data than the 99.5% quoted. If I understand correctly you get 8.78% by dividing the number of vaccinated covid deaths into the total number of covid deaths?\n",
      "But that 8.78% comes from the 58% of the population who are fully vaccinated, leaving 91.22% of deaths coming from the unvaccinated population. That suggests a rate difference of over 14:1 not 5-10:1. (And your post quoted a 5-10 rate difference.)\n",
      "And that takes no account of possible characteristic differences between the two groups. I am not sure how the various states rolled out the vaccines in the US, but in the UK the oldest and most vulnerable were given the vaccine first. That means that, prior to any vaccinations, the vaccinated population are more at risk from covid than the unvaccinated population. Using age as an example, every additional 7 years of age roughly doubled the risk of death from covid. \n",
      "https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3259\n",
      "So if the vaccinated cohort are all 7 years older than the unvaccinated cohort, you would expect the death rate (before any vaccine effect) to be twice as high in the vaccinated group as in the unvaccinated group. If the vaccinated group are all 14 years older, the expected deaths would be 4x different.\n",
      "I have no idea what the different age profiles of the two groups are, but it could be very different between the two, not least because the unvaccinated group includes all the pre-teens in the country. If the adjusted age gap is 15-20 years that would move the 14:1 ratio up into the 90s:1 which is the sort of numbers that are being shown in studies in the UK at least.\n",

      "Let's face one fact in America no matter how bitter is the truth. Everything is politicized including the governmental agencies which are supposed to be neutral and non-political. If these conditions persisted a year ago, CDC would have been giving us a more dire scenario. The bad news would not have been brushed under the carpet as it is being done now. The MSM used to give us practically a running commentary on who is being admitted to the hospital with Covid infection and the situation. Now the statistic is more like a minor footnote in their reporting if any.\n",
      "Americans are getting way too complacent about the vaccination and the virus. In my line of work I have to meet a few clients every now and then. It is the elderly who can be the most vulnerable are the most complacent. It is common for the people in their 70s, 80s and even 90s not to wear the face mask because they are vaccinated. Almost a year ago, one of my colleague Christine's client Albert, a 90 year old gentleman was going to come to the office. Christine normally works from home and comes only one day a week and leaves early. She said that she will help him if she is around otherwise if I could. Albert came late and she was gone. After I had helped him, Albert put his hand out to shake mine. Hesitantly I did shake his hand. Next he asked me to take my mask off so he could see my face. Feeling awkward I did take it off for a couple of seconds.\n",
      "Today when I go to supermarket or many other indoor places lots of people are not wearing face masks. Vaccination is only 60% to 80% effective. For the next year or two at least we should try to wear as much as possible. This is a small sacrifice we all can make rather than going into a lockdown mode again and businesses being shut.\n",

      "What's insane is that this final step doesn't require \"totalitarian control\" as the case numbers were small. It requires professionalism and rigor in contact tracing, and potentially focussed surge testing. \n",
      "By nature of the small counts, it's not a huge effort that one can put down to a communist regime, but rather a quality and focussed effort that any country should be able to manage. Particularly any developed nation.\n",
      "With the way the world has gone, though populations will have to acquire immunity. Better done through vaccine that infection, and if the vaccines are leaky but protective against hospitalisation and death then vaccination and then a mild infection might be better than no vaccine and infection.\n",

There may be higher priorities than repeating an experiment where it's 99.99% certain you'll get the answer you already know. There may be some information you can then publish which is irrelevant to the CDC but useful in public messaging, but that's another matter.\n",
      "All vaccines that are rolled out in an emergency are issued under Emergency Use provision, globally. That's what they're for. Since I don't want millions to die needlessly, I'm glad those provisions are there. They've had Phase 3 trials which is all they'd get under non-emergency provisions. They'd just take the monitoring of side effects more slowly.\n",

This is a statistical disaster, they should have an unknown group. This can easily make the figure twice as bad as presented even now.They continue to push vaccine passports, that in reality are now useless as the vaccine seems to only half the transmitability of a variant that is twice as transmitable as the previous one.

      "An anyway mask or no mask is not declaring victory. Masks are a fractional addition to protection, mostly of others. We know from multiple scientific studies, outside the USA if you don't trust US ones, that vaccinated individuals are less likely to be infected, and if they are they typically have a much lower viral load so should shed less. So in the cost-benefit analysis it is a way to loosen up for the part of the population that has done the right thing (so maybe a bit of carrot-and-stick there).\n",
      "It's not something I would do, and my country has retained masks in public transport, crowded indoor places such as stores, and for teenagers in crowded indoor parts of the school. But mask-wearing is not the massively polarised political issue I read it is in the USA. So maybe they think striking a compromise will get the best overall outcome. That's part of the scientists' job, which is why those committees usual include social scientists as well as epidemiologists and vaccinologists. And maybe it was the right overall balance with Alpha, but not with Delta where people shed ten times as much virus.\n",

But regardless, the loud, ideologically-driven anti-vaxxers are better represented in the media in the form of Tucker Carlson etc., support for their views appears to overlap significantly with support for other conspiracy theories which carry an outsize political weight, and they appear better able to evangelise for their cause - even if it's only amongst their own political cohort - than people who are just hesitant about getting the vaccine for (mostly fictitious) health reasons, or for reasons relating to religion.\n",

      "The trouble is, there's a huge amount of pressure from the US media, political activists, even the White House to some extent, to downplay and mislead people about the limited effectiveness of the vaccines for partisan reasons. Vaccination is seen as a left-wing, anti-Trump cause and anything which calls into question the idea that the US could just end Covid right now if it wasn't for those dangerous Trump-supporting Republican anti-vaxxers a dangerous act of betrayal. For example, many point to stats like the one mentioned in the article about how only a tiny proportion of people who're vaccinated have been hospitalized or died to insist that headlines accurately reporting on how much vaccines are believged reduce the risk of being infected, hospitalized or dying are misleading. In reality, the smaller stats are the misleading ones - only a tiny proportion of the US population in general have been hospitalized or died over the time period where vaccines have been available, but since people don't have that information to compare to they think it says more about the effectiveness of vaccines than it really does.\n",

Our Health Minister web site gives up-dated and plenty of information and data.All TVs are doing it as well, daily, many times a day. And we, people, are paying great attention. I believe that this is connected to the general care we Italians have for health. We (left,center or right) care a lot about how is produced our food, about the quality of our water and air, about the quality of almost every good we buy and use. I believe we are the only country that, after Chernobyl, refused atomic energy by referendum. In the past 3 years, having more free time available, I have collected as many information as possible about the US and UK, mainly following the astonishment about US people choice of Trump as president and the UK decision to leave EU. I believe that neither in the US nor in the UK there is a similar popular attitude.

All who are unkown status are assemwd unvaxinated. This is a disaster.If the average age is 65 and the vaccination rate is 70% in this age group. 7 of 10 unknowns are in fact vaccinated.Reporting 95 out of 100 vaccinated is great, but if 10% are unknowns, another 7 are actually breakthrough deaths, taking 95 to 88%.It's the middle of summer and it's worse than last summer, nobody is taking this into consideration.The number or childred getting hospitalized in the USA is a concern. 300 per day is a lot, anecdotally it is worse on the young, data not available yet.Last year 600,000 died in the USA with plenty of mitigation in place.If it's 5x better, that's still 120,000 with mitigation, how many without.This winter may we'll be as and as the last one.\n",
