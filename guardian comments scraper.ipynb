      "The problem with Nick Cohen's writing here is a lack of logic, produced by a lack of courage. On the one hand:\n",
      "\"Like so much insider jargon, neoliberal is a pathetically weak term. To take an everyday example: since Thatcher’s government privatised the water industry in 1989, managers and shareholders have exploited their monopoly power to take almost £60bn in profit. In 2020, the companies spent 3.1m hours dumping sewage into rivers. So great has been their failure to reinvest even a small portion of the money they take, south-east England may soon face water shortages.\"\n",
      "Dead right. But then:\n",
      "\"Only moderate centre-left parties have won elections in western countries and their victories are rare enough. If you insist that they are as much a part of a neoliberal conspiracy as the right, then there is no point in fighting to remove the right from power.\"\n",
      "So Nick understands that privatisation of water has been disastrous, and by implication other public services too. But the \"moderate centre-left parties\" are defined by their unwillingness to do anything about it. \n",
      "\"... the far left... must maintain there is no difference between Tony Blair’s Labour government and any government Keir Starmer may lead, and the Tories. I once believed that, but the brutality of David Cameron’s actual Conservative government made me think again.\"\n",
      "When it comes to bringing water, and other services, back into public ownership, there is no difference. Keir Starmer is not going to reverse the disastrous policy. Indeed, he's just demoted Ed Miliband for suggesting that public ownership in the power industry is still Labour's policy. Starmer has totally abandoned the platform on which he was elected Labour leader only eighteen months ago.\n",
      "It is tragedy that Nick Cohen, and others, attacked the one political leader of recent times who would have restored our pubic services. There was one election that proved that it's not just \"moderate centre-left parties\" that win elections. In 2017 Labour nearly won an election, called specifically because the Tories looked like winning a landslide. Labour got 40% of the vote, only 2% behind the Tories, on a platcform which included reversing exactly the Thatcher privatisations which Nick, rightly, abhors. The 2019 election result doesn't alter that. It happened. \n",
      "Instead of supporting that platform, however critically, Nick preferred to lambast it and its supporters as \"fucking fools\" (quote) in this paper. There was a real movement, especially among young people, to reverse the political direction of the last forty years. Nick just stuck that new phenomenon into a mould of older left politics. It was \"far left\". And he and others helped destroy it.\n",
      "I think, if Nick had been around in 1945, he would have refused to support the Labour party under Attlee because there were so many \"Communists\" or \"fellow travellers\" in the party and around it. There were people who did exactly that. For the sake of their preconceptions they failed support public ownership of public services, and the creation of the NHS. Perhaps one day Nick and others will wake up. Until then, the \"negligent protfiteers\" will carry on winning.\n",

      "Ronnie and Maggie certainly did not usher in a liberal or neoliberal age. Liberalism meant freedom for the many, the greatest good for the greatest number.\n",
      "What Ronnie and Maggie brought upon the world was a system of neofeudalism, in the worst sense of the word. \n",
      "Original feudalism involved paternalistic care of the liege lord for the vassals, combined with the good works of the church for those left behind. Neofeudalism was and is certainly not based on any idea of looking after your vassals or retainers. Instead of behaving like liege lords, the controllers of the money flows behave like robbver barons. And their effect has not by any means been anything like Hayek's ’creative destruction' as a precursor for new creation. \n",
      "Reformed liberal capitalism of the Rhenanian type, dubbed 'soziale Marktwirtschaft' in Germany, coupled 'destruction' of outdated industries with 'creative construction', offering incentives, but above all professional and vocational instruction and training of a quality and scale quqite unheard of in Britain. It produced a workforce that would instantly cause long queues if it set up shop anywhere in the UK. And it managed the transformation of the Stalinist economy of what the Russian occupation force dubbed the German Democratic Republic (with Vlad Putin as one of the KGB residents).\n",
      "Moreover, as a number of Continental economies show, the shift from manufacturing to service economies were only partial. And a lot of the services are subservient to industrial production. After all King Midas could not live on bullion, nor services.\n",
      "What some understand as (neo)liberalism has in fact been akin to the setup of late robber baron feudalism in the 'autumn' of the Middle Ages (eg the Wars of the Roses), in that \"the Bank of England and the Foreign Office enabled the creation of tax havens that allowed plutocrats, corporations and criminals to hoard their money with disastrous and enduring consequences for humanity\". Utterly unproductive and inefficient crony capitalism, quite unlike the unfettering of productive forces. The evidence is Britain's poor productivity, lack of competitive edge, asset-stripping, negative balance of payments, and above all poor pay. Evinced by the elementary fact that there is no market price for the human habitat.\n",
      "Calling Ronnie's and Maggie's by anything containing the term 'liberal' or 'neoliberal' is an insult to liberal (and Marxist) thinkers of the nineteenth century. John Stuart Mill must be rotating in his grave.\n",
      "There is a lot wrong in Russia, but at least there is a certain terminological honesty expressed by word 'prikhvatisatsia', privatisation as seizure by might. Kitchen language captures 'the banditry of crony capitalism by talking of robbers, looters and frauds'. Vlad Putin as the world's first trillionaire, as shown in Navalny videos.\n",

      "\"No one admits to being a “neoliberal”. You cannot vote for the Neoliberal party or join a neoliberal club. Like 21st-century fascism and religious fundamentalism, neoliberalism is a movement without declared adherents.\"...\n",
      "Yes, that's quite correct and I had personal experiences both here in The Guardian, with Australian posters that I strongly suspect are associated with the Neoliberal think-tank \"Institute of Public Affairs\" (IPA), based in Melbourne; and, before that, with similar posters writing their opinions in The Drum online of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). So, it is true that, currently, the Neoliberals deny that they exist, why would they do that? Simple, if you don't exist you can't be the target of analyses, criticisms and the offer of alternatives. You cannot be identified as the \"side of politics to beat\"... you are just a ghost.... doing very many nasty things, without being seen, let alone scared away.... But the Neoliberals cannot hide: By their deeds you will recognise them!\n",
      "Historically, however, the Neoliberals did start by proudly identifying themselves. In fact, the term Neoliberalism was introduced by Alexander Rustow at the \"Walter Lippmann Colloquium\" in Paris in 1938, his objective was to offer a new liberalism as an alternative to collectivism, socialism, and laissez-faire liberalism. By Neoliberalism Rustow meant an economic system that prioritises price mechanisms, free enterprise, competition, and a strong and impartial state, to which it was subsequently added deregulation, privatisation, and inequality. In 1951, Milton Friedman wrote that: \"Neo-liberalism would accept the nineteenth century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would substitute for the nineteenth century goal of laissez faire as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive order.\"\n",
      "Subsequently, Neoliberalism spread throughout the capitalist world since the end of the 1970s-beginning of the 1980s, to be also adopted by former communist countries in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union. Sadly, during that period, Neoliberalism also sucked in an entire generation of Social Democrats around the world. It took the GFC of 2008 to start an ongoing process of De-Neoliberalisation of Western Social Democratic parties.\n",
      "The Neoliberals cannot hide at all, just Google (or Google Scholar) \"Neoliberalism\" and you will see the shower of articles and books that you will get on the topic.\n",

      "\"Neo-liberal\" as difficult as a term and confusing to some, because \"liberal\" can be used to mean 100 different things. In this case, it is referring to economic liberalism - free marketeering - downgrading state interference and regulation, upgrading privatisation, voluntary industry standards, reducing universal welfare state and education. It's not a 'conspiracy' any more than Keynesianism - it's just an descriptor of an economic model. Lots of people would argue that neo-liberalism has worked well for the world - propelling social change through strengthened economies and strong business models. I don't agree that the term is take to be necessarily insulting. \n",

      "I agree neoliberalism is not well defined, Starmer's relationship to the Labour party membership is now well defined, it is defined by betrayal, ten promises he has now made clear he will not keep and the promise he has kept to is to exclude the left.\n",
      "How should the Left respond to Starmer's attacks and exclusion from the shadow cabinet? The Left gave Blair conditional and critical support in the hope some progress would be achieved. What little progress was made under Blair, under pressure from the Left of the party, was quickly rolled back when the Tories returned to power and any progress made under any 'centrist' Labour party leadership is quickly rolled back and the same will be true of a Starmer government. The Left argument was that it has to give the Labour party critical and conditional support in order for working-class(the wealth creators) are taken through a political 'process' and learn from experience the limitations of 'centrist' Labour government and after the working class(the wealth creators) learn this lesson the most politically conscious layers would learn that Left-wing politics represent working-class(the wealth creators) interests. This strategy didn't work with the Blair government and has not worked in over a century of trying. If a strategy does not work where is the logic in sticking to it?\n",
      "The Left with potential funding from UNITE now available should build a socialist party to offer politics that would upend and overthrow the political status quo. The Left need to represent the political interests of the working-class(the wealth creators) and stop feeding working-class9the wealth creators) alienation from politics and stop working to elect Labour governments under ‘centrist’ cuckoos who offer the working class (the wealth creators) a few more crumbs off the capitalists extravagant dining tables. The Left knows and has no illusions that Starmer will tinker with the system, he will not change anything fundamentally and the Left knows Starmer is another Blair and under successive Blair, governments increasing numbers of working-class(the wealth creators) became alienated from politics and stopped voting. The Left knows the working class(the wealth creators) need fundamental change, the Left needs to offer that fundamental change.\n",

      "None of the governments mentioned were neo-liberal, which i would describe as allowing the capitalist system to operate as unhindered by government policies or regulations as possible: and accepting that countries should concentrate on those areas of economic activity where they had a competitive advantage. That's why \"neo-liberals\" like Raab & Minford wanted the UK to leave the EU: because it was too interventionist. And why Minford fully expected the UK to lose most if not all of our manufacturing industry post-Brexit and accepted it as being inevitable.Neoliberalism has been confused with the view that the private sector can run utilities better than the public sector. Although a notion that capitalist competition would make these industry be leaner and fitter was present, that was a secondary consideration: not least because certain industries (e.g. water and railways) are in effect natural monopolies where competition is impossible, in practice. Hence the results for the privatised water industry which Cohen mentions, which have little, if anything to do with neoliberalism.The extent to which governments since 1979 carried out or believed in neoliberal policies varied. Blair & Brown barely challenged the ideology that capitalist competition was an effective basis for the economy, while plainly content to use government regulation (including EU regulation) as necessary. In a country where the majority of voters don't vote for the conservatives, inevitably any government is required to respond to majority opinion: hence moves towards less regulation have been more limited than the promises. What we have in practice is a partly-regulated capitalism in an economy which is based largely on rentier capitalism, with the Johnson government adding a new level of crony capitalism. Of course, there are some extreme left wingers who attack politicians they abhor as supporting neoliberalism: but at the extreme, many would do away with capitalism altogether, while probably most would be content with nationalising the natural monopolies & regulating much further.However, a more important question than any of this analysis is how or if capitalism can adapt to the challenges of climate change?\n",

      "None of his personal corruptions, however, can hide the truth that Johnson is a nationalist, who appeals to deep chauvinist sentiments rather than class interests. No economic liberal, neo or otherwise, would pull the UK out of the world’s richest single market. Conservatives fooled themselves that Brexit would bring a deregulated society. But we should pay more attention to the world as it is than to the fantasies of the delusional and see that, instead of a Singapore-on-Thames, they have undermined exporters and brought tax to its highest level since the 1960s, an era the Thatcher revolution supposedly finished off.\n",

      "This is the huge contradiction of Brexit, indeed. The main protagonists always had the intention to position the UK as low regulation, low tax competitor to the \"bureaucratic\" EU, only to be drowned in red tape, extra buraucracy and lower competitiveness of the British economy in the real world of modern trade. \n",
      "Thatcher, hardly a pro-European herself and an English nationalist as well, knew this. She was pragmatic enough to understand the huge benefits of a big common market with unified standards and low / non-existent barriers of trade. \"Neo-liberal\" or not, that is just common sense. \n",
      "The chauvinist Torykippers lack that common sense, just like the \"Lexiter\" useful idiots on the far-left who believe that a socialist utopia is now on the horizon for Britain after having left the EU. A socialist utopia that was delivered by the most shady fringes of the Conservative party who would would rather sell their own grandmother than increase social standards. \n",
      "Plus, there is the factor of a globalised economy. Europe does not exist in a vaccum. Only the big common market allows Europe to keep the relatively high social standards. Europe can not compete with China on price.

The whole of it was designed to confuse and divert, to keep people looking too closely at it's effects. Words used to disguise Reality. Just like Liberalism itself.\n",
      "I'm at risk of serially repeating myself here but it's again relevant, and as it's the heart of our Society it will remain so. Western Liberal Society is based around the claim that we voluntarily give up Freedom in exchange for the Security Society can offer us. \n",
      "All our Politics, Left or Right, revolve around this. Every debate in Parliament, or Congress, or any other form of Government in Western Liberalism, is about one question: How much Freedom do we have to give up, and how much Security do we get in return?\n",
      "How much Tax should we pay? Has the Government the Right to enforce Lockdown? How much do we spend on the NHS? Can we ban smoking in Public Places? All these are different forms of that same question. Everything in Liberal Society revolves around that question.\n",
      "NeoLiberalism, as far as I understand it, simply equates Wealth more directly with Freedom. Instead of Wealth being a proxy for Freedom, an abstract form of it, NeoLiberalism says they are the same and so should be treated the same. So when you are putting controls on Wealth you are putting controls on Freedom. \n",
      "And because we are a Liberal Society and we should limit controls on Freedom as much as possible, then we shouldn't control the use or the accumulation of Wealth. It's not the business of the State, outside the negotiation of how much we should be expected to give up for Security.\n",
      "It's just as much a crock of shit as the rest of Liberalism. It's based on complete nonsense. None of it makes sense in the real world, and all of it is the root cause of Humanity's problems. NeoLiberailism isn't the problem, Liberalism is.\n",

      "I use the term meaning a world view that treats the market and capitalism not as a useful economic tool, but as something untouchable that is supposed to bring solutions in all kinds of areas. Capitalism not as a mere economic system but as a guiding principle for everything.I associate the term with a drive to privatize everything as well as confusing democracy with socialism. Everything is being called \"socialist\" even when it is just democratic common sense as soon as there is a role for the state in it. Not wanting to privatize infrastructure is not socialist.Similarly there is the idea that society doesn't exist as such, but that it is nothing but a collection of individuals. Which is true in a sense, but that it similar to saying a table doesn't exist as it is nothing but a collection of atoms. There is also the idea connected to it that there is no such thing as public service and that politicians are always only out for their own interest. Which is of course a perfect justification for corruption and goes hand in hand with the disdain for regulation. Of course criminals dislike regulation and red tape.In other words \"neoliberalism\" is denying the existence of a public sphere in the democratic sense as this view denies the very existence of a public as well as the idea of a \"public interest\". The \"state\" is seen as something alien and evil, best reduced to as small an existence as possible. This worldview is fundamentally anti-democratic in my opinion. There is complete lack of understanding that in a democracy the state is the political representation of the people. Maybe a different term would be better than \"neoliberalism\", the term doesn't matter as much. But these concepts are widespread, influential and - in my view at least - very damaging.\n",

      "“What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August, 1914! ... The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighboring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But, most important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable.”\n",

      "It's very obviously true that there was a tendential growth in the functions exercised via the public rather than private sphere post-wwii to the 1970s, and that this trend then revesed, broadly speaking, for the next decades up to roughly 2008. This is the case for the UK, but also dozens of countries (with slightly different dates and to slightly different degrees) from the US to Mexico to Germany to Indonesia. \n",
      "There are clearly nuances to this, as one would expect from a global tendency which impacted unevenly across the world and mixed with existing socio-economic arrangements. But that complexity at the local scale does not in anyway negate what is a very clearly evident global trend over time. This is not really arguable. \n",
      "Second, if you know anything about the support for brutal dictatorships from Latin America to SE Asia by what might broadly he called neoliberal economists, or about the social impacts of IMF-demamded austerity programmes across the developing world, you wouldn't regard 'neoliberal' as such a toothless condemnation.\n",
      "And last, if you'd followed even really mainstream debates in recent years, from Adam Tooze to Ian Bremner to Branko Milanovic, and even occasionally on these pages, you'd be aware that there's been a great deal of discussion over the new global populist right and whether that represents a new and distinc phenomenon from neoliberalism. Personally my view is that the latter is (unevenly) breaking down, as the economy tendentially stagnates and the state is gradually stepping in to backstop profit-making in various ways- and some of this is explicitly justified in terms of competing with China, where the state already excerises those functions to a much greater degree.\n",

      "I can’t speak for academia, but in politics I know that the cry “neoliberal” is a certain sign that I am in the presence of the far left. It must maintain there is no difference between Tony Blair’s Labour government and any government Keir Starmer may lead, and the Tories.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be fair that isn't a leftwing delusion. Tony Blair's government would have been to the right of the majority of Post-war Conservative governments. Look at its record.\n",
      "Taxes weren't increased on the rich, major landowners were left untouched, the financial sector was barely regulated, there was no industrial policy and British company after British company was either sold off or run into the ground by incompetent British executives. Blair's government did nothing to restrain private equity and did nothing about the reward for failure culture of rich Britain. While barely enforcing the minimum wage and leaving it at poverty levels.\n",
      "The only leftwing things they did was, one increase public speeding. Something which happened in the middle of a boom fuelled by debt and a housing bubble. The Tories would have done the same and much of Labour's spending was diverted to their pals in the private sector via ripoff PFI schemes.\n",
      "The second leftish thing they did was a vague embrace of identity politics, which is something wealthy types on the left love to do, to pretend they haven't gone full Tory. A bit of feminism here, a quota there doesn't threaten their second home or their kids private education.\n",

      "Neoliberal can mean many things, but usually it is taken to mean the \"Washington Consensus\" of policies, which has been described 20 years ago by Peter Mandelson this way:\n",
      "“in the urgent need to remove rigidities and incorporate flexibility in capital, product and labour markets, we are all Thatcherites now”\n",
      "Of these by car the most important has been \"Labour market reform”, that is lower wages and more insecure jobs thanks to anti-union policies and competition fro offshoring and immigrants. The second has been globalized capital markets, and more flexibility in product markets has been a distant third as policy goal (except in the EU).\n",
      "But politically neoliberalism is different from the original liberalism in some very important aspect: the state funding, bailing out, and in general protecting of the interests of incumbents, such as property and finance rentiers, which was extraneous to the original of liberalism, under which the state should not have any \"national champtions\" or favoured constituencies.\n",
      "So in practice apart from cheaper wages and globalized capital and products, he other essential component of neoliberalism has been high inflation rates of housing costs, and an ever growing percentage of GDP consumed by the finance sector, which have given neoliberal politics the support of two important constituencies, property owners as votes for neoliberalism, and finance spivs as \"sponsors\".\n",

So great has been their failure to reinvest even a small portion of the money they take, south-east England may soon face water shortages.\" \n",

It is an issue that resonates almost as much with the average Tory as with centre and left wing parties. It ought to be one of the issues that unseats this corrupt and purulent shower from power.

Johnson (and to a lesser extent brexit) represents something opposed to the pro globalisation of Blair and Cameron.

Tough choices that fell on the backs of poorest. \n",

You can call it whatever you want, global Thatcherism/Reaganism or whatever but you cannot avoid what it is: a supposedly liberal economic and social order or settlement that flows out of the west's supposed triumph over the USSR when it was believed that all we needed to do was put a McDonalds in every former Soviet state, China, the Middle East etc because apparently no countries with a McDonalds ever went to war. Back then Fukuyama was declaring the end of history. It's an order that elevates the market to the highest realm as the one and only solution to humanity's contemporary problems. Some of us are old enough to recall the World Bank, IMF etc foisting this order on developing countries in the form of structural adjustment programmes, which essentially meant privatising public assets, from healthcare to education. You can see it in Latin America, in Africa etc, the outcome of the Thatcherite belief that there's no such thing as a society but individuals. There's a reason Thatcher called Blair his true heir.

Politically expedient yes (I think the US populace is generally sick and disillusioned with the war in Afghanistan) but the two alternatives are to stick or twist. Continuing a never-ending mission with Taliban marginal gains and an ongoing civil war or another surge with a more committed attempt at nation building. One an unpopular 'meh' decision (with US and Afghan populace, allies and with a natural enemy in sight), the other a significant investment with no real success horizon in sight.\n",
