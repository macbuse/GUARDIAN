      "This is a hypocritical, contradictory argument. There is absolutely zero ‘epistemological humility’ from your side of the scientific debate.\n",
      "You say:\n",
      "“It’s fine for scientists to become advocates of a particular policy so long as they are transparent about where expertise stops and advocacy begins. There is no such thing as public policy informed purely by science; as we have seen with Covid-19, policy juggles limited scientific knowledge alongside economic considerations and normative value judgments informed by competing political ideologies.”\n",
      "I would absolutely, 100% agree, but why does this principle not apply to the scientists or scientific theories you evidently put more store by? Do they not also have biases too? Can they not be “pushing their own values” or be “co-opted by shady ideological interests?” The investment of Big Tech in the lockdown regime is clear for all to see, yet to speculate that certain forms of big business might benefit from lockdowns opens one up to the charge of conspiracy theorism. And yet you get to truck your own conspiracy theory that these scientists are part of a shady ideological plot. Maybe they are - in which case I would like to know; but this goes both ways.\n",
      "You are right that all scientists and scientific institutions have value-biases. There may be one split second when the science is pure as it is formulated in someone’s head, but the moment it is applied to the world it is value-based. It is institutionalised. Knowledge as power as Foucault said. \n",
      "I think value-bias is a good thing; it means we don’t just do things because they can be scientifically rationalised but stop and think about the human and ethical implications. The problem is one when people do not state value-biases. And more often than not, these scientists you criticise do own up to a bias towards freedom. They say that a lockdown state is incompatible with a free society. Now, you might take issue with their concept of freedom, and that’s absolutely fine; but don’t pretend it’s just them who have a bias and it is you who are on the side of pure science. How often do pro-lockdown scientists state their biases? \n",
      "My opposition to lockdown is based not on science but my bias against closed borders, extra-parliamentary decrees, surveillance, mass inmiseration and the destruction of educational and cultural institutions. I don’t care what the science says - my bias will remain. Whatever the ‘data’ coming from these algorithmic models says, my values will not change. I am proudly biased against a biosecurity state. \n",
      "So this is a discussion about values. Yet if we are talking evidential science, there is not one peer-reviewed paper in existence on the efficacy of lockdown. In fact, prior to 2020 the concept of a lockdown did not exist. The word does not even occur in public health literature. The WHO themselves admitted that China’s lockdown policy has no precedent in science or public health history. So all these scientists are basing their authority on a policy devised by a brutal, totalitarian regime that lies through its teeth a matter of months ago, and that has never been tested or studied in history - and you accuse these Barrington Science of lacking epistemological humility? No!\n",

      "This is pretty clearly the same thing as climate-change 'skepticism', isn't it? Some 'libertarian' organisation – for which read 'group of very rich psychopaths' – funds a group of plausible-sounding scientists to write some plausible-sounding paper about a subject which disagrees with the scientific orthodoxy about it in a way which just so happens to align with the interests of the rich psychopaths. Those interests being, broadly 'we must keep getting richer, and nothing else matters – if lots of little people die we don't care, if we are burning the entire future of civilisation we don't care – all that matters is us, now, and we will exploit and corrupt any ideology to further our own immediate interests'.\n",
      "In the case of climate-change 'skepticism' it took many years to really conclusively establish what was going on: even though it was obvious, the 'mainstream' (for which read 'competent') scientists correctly insisted on actually doing the science to show that the suspiciously-well-funded 'skeptics' were in fact just wrong, even if they were not quite actually lying. And while this was the right thing to do, it took so long to do it that the 'skeptics' had swayed public opinion – or the opinion of enough of the public, anyway – so far that there's almost no chance we will deal with climate change in any useful way, and a very large number of people will die as a result of that (but not the very rich psychopaths, of course).\n",
      "In this case we don't have the time. By the time the actual scientists have shown that the suspiciously-well-funded 'skeptics' are wrong even if they are not quite lying, the epidemic will be over. And the consequences of their not-quite-lies will be that a large number of people will have died who did not need to die, and a small group of very rich psychopaths will have got richer.\n",
      "Well, at least they will only kill a few million people this way: this is an almost entirely number compared to the number their climate-change counterparts will kill. And, of course, the people they kill will, very conveniently, be the poor, the elderly, the non-white. The sort of people who count least in the minds of the very rich psychopaths.\n",

      "Looking at other coronaviruses, herd immunity from natural infection is magical thinking. About a fifth of cold viruses are coronaviruses and nobody develops lasting immunity to them. Even SARS and MERS antibodies disappear after a very short time.\n",
      "There is also a difference between the immune system response to mild and more serious infections- mild infections in young people seem to be quickly fought off via T cells and, whilst there may be development of memory T cells, antibodies aren’t necessarily needed. This could lead people to be asymptomatic carriers. \n",
      "Severity of illness also depends on how much of the virus someone is exposed to and how reactive their immune system is - the more widespread the virus is, the bigger the group of people who will be vulnerable to serious illness. We have already seen in the first wave in Italy and Spain that the age range of hospitalised patients widens as infections increase. Whilst people may survive, they are often left with long term effects. There is increasing evidence that people with mild Covid can experience long term debilitating effects. Not enough data is being collected to research this in the UK and people are struggling to get help from their GPs - part of the problem is the extremely limited number of symptoms the NHS officially recognises as being linked to Covid.\n",
      "The phrase ‘vulnerable people’ is meaningless- such a large number of people have ‘underlying conditions’ (especially if you include race, weight, age and pregnancy status) and live in a wide range of different situations that it is a logistical impossibility to protect them from catching the virus if measures aren’t taken to suppress it. The best methods should be to have an effective test, trace and quarantine system and to ensure personal measures such as mask wearing when out of the house and distancing are fully observed by everyone.\n",

NHS, other countries should be able to produce risk by age, pre existing conditions - that would allow GPs / public to know who was at higher risk and even what percentage higher risk. If you have a medical operation you are told a percentage chance of failure, possibly of death.On bias.. Scientist can be biased, politics definitely can be biased, politicians who Pick their choice of scientific advisor definitely biased.I can't see that anyone can say ukgov has delivered on covid to date 10 months into covid. You can look at list of countries before as a benchmark.Even Economist mag list Taiwan as less economic damage, deaths.. Just 7 in 10 months.Article ignores huge damage to UK caused by lock down 1 (lol with lock down 2 coming, because stupid ukgov lost control again!)40,000 deadNHS shut.. Causing huge backlog & wait list for decade to come.Education damage by lost months of school (or even uni!)Death of high streetDeath of office with wfhHuge increase in unemployment already and to come. Huge covid debt to be repaid by ukpublic for decades. If 'at risk' for covid can be defined (under 40 and no other conditions? ) and they can work and live normally.. It saves 50% plus of the economy (retirement age 65 ish). Even if covid immunity is short lived (lve read possibly months) that reopening of the economy still allows UK economy, education, highstreet, NHS etc to function. The rest shield..In time if immunity, better treatment etc proved..

But the criticisms levelled at her have been excruciatingly hypocritical. From people who were just as far out wrt to severity but in other direction (citing 1%+ and even 3-4% as credible range back in March). Furthermore, her biggest concern she has always stated has been the effects in the developing world where the numbers at risk of hunger from fall-out could far outweigh C-19 impact. She is not being addressed at all in good faith by other experts who have been astonishingly quick to try and shut down such debate, claim consensus as if this is climate science not a position developed in last 6 months, and seek to discredit with completely unfounded personal attacks (sharing the risible Byline Times article for instance).\n",

Are you really qualified to declare that professors of medicine and related sciences at prestigious universities are engaging in \"bad science\" and beholden to \"shady ideological interests\"? Can't we just accept that experts in the field are divided over the best response to the coronavus outbreak? The policies outlined in the declaration seem more plausible to me than dodgy \"rules of six\" and the other hodge podge of restrictions which vary from country to country, region to region, and are all claimed by politicians to be \"based on the science\". Healthy young people in Britain are more likely to be knifed to death by their peers than to die of COVID. If the focus were shifted to protecting the elderly and those with chronic health problems, rather than policing young people having fun and encouraging spying of pizza deliveries for more than six people, perhaps we might lower death rates even further than they are now. There was certainly a case for lockdowns and other restriction in the early days in order to give health services time to build up supplies of ventilators and protective equipment, but the restrictions now make little sense.

This is an uncomfortable read for most scientists. He contends that through the “barbarism of specialisation” a scientist is nothing more than a “learned ignoramus”.\n",

I know one of these characters very well, having been a friend and fellow student during many years at university together.)\n",

      "It doesm't actually matter whether a policy of allowing the virus to run its course whilst trying to protect the vulnerable or the kind of course that has been chosen would produce fewer deaths overall. The early losses and effective imprisonment of the vulnerable in the former strategy, and counter-intuitive nature of it, would make it politically unacceptable in the UK , even without the potential for failing to protect the vulnerable which would be high. For that strategy to work it would require people to hold their nerve, and they wouldn't and as soon as they started messing with it to ameliorate what were perceived as unacceptable effects then the any advantage it conferred could well be lost.\n",
      "Of course the UK failed to protect the vulnerable anyhow but it's politically excusable in a way that a policy that was labelled as doing nothing wouldn't be. So the UK course is set, implementing strategies to mitigate transmission among the whole population, none of which will work to a satisfactory extent unless maybe, at some point, it's decided we have to do what is necessary and stop the infected transmitting it, which requires finding them and isolating them by whatever means are necessary.Even the full lockdown didn't work that well in England though it worked much better in Scotland and many other countries but there's essentially a game of chicken going on in the advanced economies with no one wanting to be the first to go back into an economically devastating lockdown but if one does then others will probably follow on the (not necessarily correct) basis that it's less devastating if you're not the only one.\n",

It would require us to have better Test & Trace than we have. We were promised better, so setting aside the politics of that issue would it justify doing things differently if we had a better option? There is a case to argue in favour of doing things selectively. \n",

This statistic has been used to support both stop-and-frisk policies and broken windows policing, as catching those criminals committing minor crimes will supposedly net many criminals wanted for (or who would normally commit) larger ones.\n",
      "Some cases of super-spreading conform to the 20/80 rule, where approximately 20% of infected individuals are responsible for 80% of transmissions, although super-spreading can still be said to occur when super-spreaders account for a higher or lower percentage of transmissions.

      "The well-being of people is threatened in three fronts: physical health, mental health and employment/income. The challenge is to find a path that causes the minimum overall harm to people. Some would emphasise the first above all else, others the second or third. I don't pretend to know. The country should have had an open debate about this challenge because the truth is that there is no path available that causes no harm in all three categories. If the government had openly acknowledged this and encouraged thought about how to proceed based on acknowledgement of all three challenges then we might have found a bit more consensus.Where the authors of this proposal go so seriously wrong is to pretend that their conclusions are based on science. That is utter drivel. There is no science that covers this decision. There are no equations that can be solved to calculate a path of minimum overall harm. This problem is quite firmly in the domain of politics. It's utterly irresponsible for all of these people to suggest that science has any meaningful input at all into the problem of equating the impact of jobs lost to lives lost or mental health ruined. Their qualifications and positions mean nothing when faced with this problem, it is completely out of their domains of expertise - whatever they might know about the spread of disease that only says anything about the first category of harm, nothing about the other two and nothing about how to equate them.Very intelligent people can sometimes be astonishingly bad at understanding the limitations of their expertise.\n",

      "And your scientific/medical/epidemiological qualifications to critically assess the merits of either approach are?The 3 countries which did not lock down, ie, Sweden, Nicaragua and South Korea are all doing extremely well in terms of deaths. Countries locking down appear to be utterly surprised when case numbers and deaths rise when lockdown is eased. Anyone with a modicum of common sense can see that lockdown will reduce case numbers and spread, but will lead to increases when eased.At what point in the future do you see the cycle of lockdowns stopping, or are you happy to have an incompetent government, backed by possibly well-meaning but equally possibly self-interested scientists, continue to tell us what to do? Their performance so far suggests neither scientists, or \"experts\", as they like to be called, nor government has much of a clue. In medicine today, decisions are ruled theoretically by \"evidence-based facts\". These are far more likely to be \"eminence-based\" opinions of a particular group of people with the ear of politicians, medical or non-medical, and louder voices. Their final fallback position is always \"If you don't do what we say you will be responsible for thousands, possibly millions of deaths.\" A case in point being the 500,000 deaths predicted by the modelling of Neil Ferguson and Imperial College London. Even with the government getting everything wrong and delaying steps, with multiple U-turns, the deaths were a tenth of that ridiculous, publicity-seeking figure.\n",

Adopting measures to protect the vulnerable should be the central aim of public health responses to COVID-19. By way of example, nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity and perform frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors. Staff rotation should be minimized. Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home. When possible, they should meet family members outside rather than inside. A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, including approaches to multi-generational households, can be implemented, and is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals. \n",

Simple hygiene measures, such as hand washing and staying home when sick should be practiced by everyone to reduce the herd immunity threshold.

The problem is one when people do not state value-biases. And more often than not, these scientists you criticise do own up to a bias towards freedom. They say that a lockdown state is incompatible with a free society. Now, you might take issue with their concept of freedom, and that’s absolutely fine; but don’t pretend it’s just them who have a bias and it is you who are on the side of pure **SCIENCE**.

In fact, prior to 2020 the concept of a lockdown did not exist. The word does not even occur in public health literature. The WHO themselves admitted that China’s lockdown policy has no precedent in **SCIENCE** or public health history. So all these scientists are basing their authority on a policy devised by a brutal, totalitarian regime that lies through its teeth a matter of months ago, and that has never been tested or studied in history - and you accuse these Barrington **SCIENCE** of lacking epistemological humility?

Some 'libertarian' organisation – for which read 'group of very rich psychopaths' – funds a group of plausible-sounding scientists to write some plausible-sounding paper about a subject which disagrees with the scientific orthodoxy about it in a way which just so happens to align with the interests of the rich psychopaths. Those interests being, broadly 'we must keep getting richer, and nothing else matters – if lots of little people die we don't care, if we are burning the entire future of civilisation we don't care – all that matters is us, now, and we will exploit and corrupt any ideology to further our own immediate interests'.\n",

And while this was the right thing to do, it took so long to do it that the 'skeptics' had swayed public opinion – or the opinion of enough of the public, anyway – so far that there's almost no chance we will deal with climate change in any useful way, and a very large number of people will die as a result of that (but not the very rich psychopaths, of course).\n",

By the time the actual scientists have shown that the suspiciously-well-funded 'skeptics' are wrong even if they are not quite lying, the epidemic will be over. And the consequences of their not-quite-lies will be that a large number of people will have died who did not need to die, and a small group of very rich psychopaths will have got richer.\n",
      "Well, at least they will only kill a few million people this way: this is an almost entirely number compared to the number their climate-change counterparts will kill. And, of course, the people they kill will, very conveniently, be the poor, the elderly, the non-white. The sort of people who count least in the minds of the very rich psychopaths.\n",

Furthermore, her biggest concern she has always stated has been the effects in the developing world where the numbers at risk of hunger from fall-out could far outweigh C-19 impact. She is not being addressed at all in good faith by other experts who have been astonishingly quick to try and shut down such debate, claim consensus as if this is climate **SCIENCE** not a position developed in last 6 months, and seek to discredit with completely unfounded personal attacks (sharing the risible Byline Times article for instance).\n",

Can't we just accept that experts in the field are divided over the best response to the coronavus outbreak? The policies outlined in the declaration seem more plausible to me than dodgy \"rules of six\" and the other hodge podge of restrictions which vary from country to country, region to region, and are all claimed by politicians to be \"based on the **SCIENCE**\". Healthy young people in Britain are more likely to be knifed to death by their peers than to die of COVID. If the focus were shifted to protecting the elderly and those with chronic health problems, rather than policing young people having fun and encouraging spying of pizza deliveries for more than six people, perhaps we might lower death rates even further than they are now. There was certainly a case for lockdowns and other restriction in the early days in order to give health services time to build up supplies of ventilators and protective equipment, but the restrictions now make little sense.

Some would emphasise the first above all else, others the second or third. I don't pretend to know. The country should have had an open debate about this challenge because the truth is that there is no path available that causes no harm in all three categories.

That is utter drivel. There is no **SCIENCE** that covers this decision. There are no equations that can be solved to calculate a path of minimum overall harm.

It's utterly irresponsible for all of these people to suggest that **SCIENCE** has any meaningful input at all into the problem of equating the impact of jobs lost to lives lost or mental health ruined.

The article spends paragraphs arguing that the GB declaration is ideological and policy advocacy but then reluctantly has to admit that exactly the same accusation could be levelled at independent SAGE. If an academic - e.g Devi Sridhar - provides an opinion then certain newspapers supports it without question. In contrast anti lockdown = bad. Those behind the GB declaration have a right to make their argument. Just because a wider weight of scientific opinion argues to the contrary doesn’t make GB wrong. It would be quite possible for most scientists in the world to be wrong about something and a small number of hold outs to be right. Rather than seeking to undermine the credibility of the academics behind GB we should be concentrating on the substance.

See-sawing between strategies is giving us the worst not the best of both worlds.

We need openness and honesty in the debate over strategy not entrenched positions driven by ulterior motives. Instead we have local government and parliament emasculated for months then suddenly the same government ministers who are responsible suddenly telling us how important it is to involve local bodies in decision making. When together we reach the best decision we can over strategy we need to be rigorous in its implementation, with those who are chosen to lead us setting the best examples.
