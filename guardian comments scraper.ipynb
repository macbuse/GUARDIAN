      "One thing influencing Hartlepool voters has been an irrational personal hatred of Williams, the Labour candidate, based partly on his remainer history (and this election has finally given them their brexity MP), and partly - arguably mostly - on dishonest negative propaganda, amplified by the Tory campaign, from the accusation that he's got nothing to do with the area, despite the fact that he worked as a GP in Stockton, a mere 8 miles away, for years before entering politics and continued to do so while and after representing Stockton South ... to accusations, propagated on Facebook and - again - amplified by the Tory campaign, of having worked to harm hospital services at Hartlepool Hospital, when in fact he's spent the pandemic working there on the front line, has consistently acted in good faith to protect patients, and has as progressive and pro-patient a record on healthcare provision as anyone could wish: \n",
      "\n",
      "Williams supports accountable care systems in the NHS led by primary care and public health. He opposes markets within the NHS, as he feels that they promote \"expensive, complex activity\". He supports a move away from the partnership model of general practice to a system provided at scale by GP-led not-for-profit provider organisations, employing salaried physicians. Williams said, \"The law is creating unnecessary privatisation that isn’t working in the interests of patients. This is a ridiculous fragmentation of services, at a time when the rhetoric from government and NHS leaders has all been about integration.\" He has advocated for all GP trainees and newly qualified mental health nurses, social workers and community nurses being employed directly by integrated care trusts, arguing that this would reduce care costs. \n",
      "During his brief career as an MP, Williams led a debate in the House of Commons highlighting the variation in experience of new mothers when receiving postnatal GP checks, and arguing for the inclusion of a specific check six weeks after birth for maternal mental health and wellbeing to be included in the national GP contract. \n",
      "Williams was also the co-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Adverse Childhood Experiences. In his constituency Williams worked to reduce waiting times for autism diagnosis from more than four years to less than twelve months. \n",
      "In 2013 he was one of a number of local healthcare providers who tried to get the best safest option for local patients, involving the temporary relocation of some services from Hartlepool hospital when Tory cuts to the NHS were injurious to healthcare outcomes; between 2011 and 2014 alone, North Tees and Hartlepool NHS were forced to face £40m of cuts, and the cuts on NHS services and staff continued into the last budget. \n",
      "Yet he's since been instrumental in reopening an urgent care centre there. He and his co-operative of fellow locals GPs have been providing care to 300,000 patients through their non-profit collective, which was set up to fight off competition from private companies like Virgin Healthcare. As Williams has said:\n",
      "\n",
      "At that time [2013] I was a doctor looking after the interest of my patients doing the only safe thing possible. However, subsequent to that what the Tories didn't mention is my track record of bringing services back to Hartlepool hospital, so I then ordered the GPs in the fightback against these cuts. The Tories have closed the A&E back in 2011, Hartlepool was left overnight without any doctor and we worked together with the hospital to open the urgent care centre in 2017, so we're now really proud of. I did the first shifts there and I'm continuing to do shifts there during this election campaign.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Humiliating indeed for Hartlepool to have fallen for such bollocks and denied themselves his service in Parliament. Voting for a change, my arse. Tory cuts have so punished the people of this country, particularly in poorer areas, that they've bypassed rebellion, or squandered it by depositing it with the brexity camp, and voted Tory in the belief that it's the only way of saving themselves from the general pain.\n",

      "What does any of this look like? What does any of this mean? How does any of this compel Labour to keep its knackered coalition together? There's no harm in a different political opinion, but I wish we could interrogate as a society why these things are so important. Why does this view of politics hold the key?\n",
      "\"Rid the party of Corbynites like Rayner\" - Rayner has hardly had any look-in throughout 2021. Strange to direct your opprobrium towards her in particular, especially considering her heritage is not really that of a Corbynite. Ditto the banning of Momentum: why is that important? \n",
      "If we're looking at this purely from tactical cost-benefit analysis, rather than principle (which I assume is the underlying message), is Momentum so widely-recognised that it represents a net loss from the gain of mobilised activists it can draw to areas? YouGov says 30% of people have heard of it, and of that 11% have a positive opinion, 11% negative. 8% are neutral. Not exactly a hot-button topic! Rayner's got similar numbers, more positive in fact.\n",
      "I agree with you on the referendum. The dynamics in Hartlepool (my family's still up there) are dominated by Brexit, and Corbyn carries the can as leader for that monumental failing, with Starmer & McDonnell getting a look-in too. It was a pretty remarkable move to select a remainer for MP – but then again who's local, voted for Brexit, gets thru vetting, and wants to be a Labour MP these days? \n",
      "Acting like they've got pride in the country has been the dominant message from Labour for these locals. Some people agree, some people don't, I don't really care. But there's a troubling sense that \"pride in the country\" is an impossible thing for Labour to attain. If we take the line that Labour isn't proud of the country (and the corollary that people who vote for them are ashamed), what do we make of the sizeable portion of people who voted Labour in 2017, Brexit in 2019, and now have abstained or voted Tory? In those four years, have they rediscovered pride, like it's been put in the water?\n",
      "Ditto aspiration – what is that? Which voters are being lost by a lack of aspiration? Is it the majority older, majority home-owning people who've drifted away from Labour? What aspirations do they have which are being offered by the Conservatives? To grow their business on the back of shit low-paid work? To expand a buy-to-let empire? To continue to pay less tax as the public sphere around them deteriorates? Is this really aspiration - because surely if we think of aspiration as positive, developing force, would it not be the young, the upwardly-mobile, the working class who would be repulsed by a lack of aspiration? Or does it mean something else entirely: aspiring towards a society of atomised individuals, at any cost to the local and British community. Could Labour do that? Should Labour do that?\n",
      "The missing link with all of these analyses is 2017. If all of these things are true – and maybe they are! – why did Labour return its biggest majority in Hartlepool then since 2001? Was it because the attractiveness of those policies outweighed being seen as less proud in Britain? Being less aspirational? And if so, is what you've said really the key? \n",
      "Or can it be shunted out the way through a social-democratic plan that the Corbynites and Momentum produced, that accepted the result of the referendum, that evoked pride through national, public achievements, local investment and the fair day's work for fair day's pay we used to pride ourselves on, that helped people on middle incomes significantly more than that of people who are out of work, that gave the young and working class a route towards being upwardly mobile? Or was that just patronising voters? And if so, how do you square the circle?\n",
      "Hope you're well. Cheers\n",

      "So many things you could say about labour and the left and why we continually lose, many fine examples of which are here btl - its never looked more like the DM of the left. Trying to move away from blaming 'stupid voters' I would add the following reasons: 1. The left seems to be naturally inward looking, far too happy to fight its internal fights when it should be concentrating on the electorate. I'm looking forward to hearing the 'we will listen to you and learn speech' soon, of course we never actually do.2. There is no narrative for us or a story that people actually believe anymore from their experiences, most of the people on here for instance are so far in their bubbles that they think their reality is what the electorate actually experience - its not.3. An incredible ability to patronise and preach to people, Ive never seen such outrageous arrogance and aggression as I see here - even the DM would struggle - you would think you had a proud history of victory after victory to back up your 'extreme confidence' that you are so right - we don't - we are perennially losers. 4. Brilliantly going against traditional UK values of fairness and associating with elements who consistently put down the UK and its history, especially England for some reason. It may be factually correct (though much seems debatable) but huge parts of ANY countries electorate would rail against that national negativity - strategically foolish.5. Diving into identity politics with abandon despite its toxic nature and amazing ability to alienate huge numbers of people and then just being bad at it and wonderfully hoisted by the HRC - well done for enjoying the company of the BNP - wave those Palestinian flags harder boys - it will work in the end!6. Never compromising your positions to bring people into your fold, in a world of extremes especially with FPTP you need as many people in your broad church as possible and that involves compromise, something the politically pure left will NEVER do - on a positive note they did take your advice and go join the Tories - so well done there.7. Focusing on yesterdays battles - Brexit is done get over it. it might not be fair or you feel robbed but its over as is Corbyn and so many of the other things we think are important - they may be but not to the electorate in this moment - nothing really less British then being a sore whining loser - we are most unhappy when we win - everyone knows that!8. Constantly underestimating the Tories and thinking they will mess up and usher us into Downing street - wake the hell up its not going to happen. they do make mistakes but we must be positioned to capitalise on them and currently we have no position, no credibility and no real defining policies just generalised 'arn't we good people who like the NHS you mean Tories'Bit aggresive this morning from my post but I'm just so tired of losing to the Tories and our team constantly making the same mistakes again and again. If you could just start by STOPPING insulting the electorate who are ordinary people doing what they think is best for them and their families that would be a great start and at least something from this debacle. It makes us look like snotty little know-it-alls railing against the unfairness of life while the Tories look like experienced old campaigners who know life is unfair - as do so many of the 'stupid electorate'.\n",

      "The Brexit favouring public possibly think that the PM personally 'got Covid done' as reported as an apocryphal Hartlepool doorstep comment vox pop reported on BBC news yesterday. The fact that he did not attend the first 5 COBRA meetings possibly reveals a talent for delegation combined with a uniquely personal understanding of the 'j'accuse' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%27Accuse%E2%80%A6! technique by verbal House of Commons parrying like 'all you lot do is refuse to make constructive criticism' answers on the largely unwatched weekly parliamentary '2 or 3 unanswered questions' at question time. As for the role of the 'hero' view of the NHS and recent progress in modelling the genetics of viruses in Oxford University, that is all compressed into a much simpler story of 'getting it done' and looking like the 'one' who 'did it'? The answer to this impression would probably be something like ' I give thanks to our marvellous British doctors and nurses, the carers, our world class British Universities and above all the great British people, all within our proud 'awesome foursome' who really made beating Covid possible', etc, etc... Journalist politicians have a 'talent' for this phraseology. 18 months ago most politicians and the public at large would have though that 'herd immunity' was something to do with farming. 'Claiming the moment' in the most emotive way is often key in politics until things become highly obviously and transparently bad..., then even more lunatic nationalist theories can be constructed. Identifying with a flag or a subculture seems important for many, despite the fact that most of the world can now be talked to in an instant via a mobile or a computer. Perhaps that is a cause of increased nationalism also? \n",
      "It seems as if a cartoon like character who senses the implications of the decline of heavy industry 4 decades ago in terms of 'old labour' and avoids the reality of skilled European labour still arriving by jet, on occasion, to pick East Midland vegetables nevertheless constructs a 'plucky Britain' mythology that sits well with a conservative social grouping who like simple straightforward 'answers'.\n",
      "It may simply be that a social democratic model that seeks to avoid the need for food banks and negligent construction processes for mass housing is just not liked or seen as important by the majority of the population...however it is packaged. Or maybe the opposition leader has to be a bit more telegenically 'showbiz'when appearing in the fairly right of centre mass media or social media bubbles...It is more important that the circular economy with its 40 billion pound hospitality 'industry' reappears to inhabit bank balances? As for the perpetual international balance of payments question and the very inexpensive widgets in shipping containers from the possible future '2060 carbon neutral' China and elsewhere; that is just a 'sell it on' retailing opportunity. Think of the 'mark ups'...It would be reasonable to assume that the Westminster Parliament will remain with is current majority 'set up' for the next decade or two at least. In other democracies the same party remains in power for many decades.. \n",

      "Here's a comprehensive list of Labour's policies:\n",
      "1. We're not the Tories2. You seen that Starmer fella? Looks good, doesn't he? You know he's a knight of the realm? What a chap.3. ......?\n",
      "We can talk till the cows come home about how awful the Tories are (spoiler: it's a lot). But voters of all stripes respond - on some level - to positive vision. Now, the ugly truth is that for some minority of voters, 'positive' is defined by 'send the buggers back' - but it's a minority, and you don't need it to win. The issue is how you portray your message. The Tories, in my mind, will absolutely jettison the plans for investment (or at least mitigate) the second they get the chance. But it was a positive vision, even if it was lies. Labour simply did not have a vision.\n",
      "There are other issues - the strategic selection of this candidate was just stupid, the Teeside mayor gave a popularity boost to the Tories, etc - but you can't get away from the fact that Labour campaigners were sent out with no briefing on what the party's plans and hopes for the country were. This has been an issue for the whole of Starmer's leadership and it flabbergasts me that nobody in Labour thought it needed to be sorted before people actually went to the polling station.\n",
      "Sadly, the fact that Reed and other party noises suggest the party will double down on it's aimless approach is a big concern. I'm also slightly terrified that Mandelson is being rolled out to speak for the party - someone who clearly doesn't realise that 1) the Blair game is up, and for all the good he did, he undeniably damaged the party's long-term standing in parts of the country 2) Starmer has not demonstrated an ounce of the acumen, charisma or wherewithal that Blair had. 'Blairism' wasn't really popular - Blair was. Without a strong leader that approach doesn't work.\n",
      "If the party can stop treating northeners like monkeys who just want the foreigners chucked out at any cost, they might make inroads. If they can realise that they are not entitled to the support of these areas - starting by scrubbing the hideous phrase 'red wall' from use - they might progress. But the truth is that I can't believe a single soul in the country votes for Starmer (as opposed to the Labour party), because none of us know at all what his government would actually resemble.\n",
      "He of course shouldn't be pushed out, but if the party doesn't take this as a massive kick up the jacksy, then there are very dark days ahead.\n",

      "If Corbyn had been reinstated as leader, Labour would have been relegated to third place in Hartlepool, and national mirth would have known no bounds. The left, left, and inadequate left fantasy comms and management failed in 2019. It wasn't the policies so much as the presentation and much worse, the assumptions based on a Milne-esque nostalgia of 'we will beat the whites with the red wedge' wrapped in the wrong flag no longer flying here.\n",
      "What is apparent from Hartlepool and current results of northern council's is a regionalisation of a political identity. These northern bricks no longer want to be told what to think by the big girl's blouse of centralised southern 'woke'. As one flustered RBL said for all the wrong reasons, in a moment of ironic, unrecognised, genius, 'I am a woman, I am a northern woman'! This is the Brexit effect, of a faux nationalism that over rode and split traditional party solidarities, as the data predicted. Policy is no longer of interest, only attention seeking belligerence of the disempowered, now handed a weaponised language to define their displaced discontent, for political ends. \n",
      "The great un-led, make their own decisions, for better or for worse, in a solidarity of regional identity and belonging. It makes no odds, in years of traditional promises undelivered, makes them vulnerable to new shiney promises, in a new contrived culture of national bribery, each to their own. To every promised freeport its new runway, real construction jobs for real men, never mind but few will see the big money of the longterm jobs run by professionals from India and Hong Kong. What do you think a freeport is for?\n",
      "Labour reorganise, re-democratise the party, and regionalise with regional leadership, prepare for cooperative devolved regional politics and empower the voice of the regions. The tories already realised the possibility of this divide and rule, and their idea of devolution is over-powerful mayors. Individuals that can be pressured. Many maybe Labour persuasion at present, but imagine if they become independent or tory. Carpe diem Labour the idea has to be big, really big! This country is post the purity of unified party ideologies. In our fractured state, what ever comes through that door of anarchic uncertainty, we have a much better chance of prevailing if we truly cooperate, and we can agree on just one thing. For something better, this archaic, unwritten constitution must fall.\n",

      "This was another insightful column by Ms. Hyde and tries to go some way about what has been ailing the Labour Party for the last few years and, more important, what - if anything - they might be able to do about arresting the decline. There is an earnestness about Labour about doing better, but they appear crestfallen about how to engage with voters they see(?) as so clearly voting against their own or the national interest. They were decimated in Scotland after the 2014 Referendum and have yet to figure out how to win back that lost support. \n",
      "I have already seen some truly astonishing surges for the Liberal Democrats in local councils across England, which (to be honest) I didn't see coming. More than 40% in Leave-voting Sunderland to wrest control from Labour! Perhaps a clue may be in something as fundamental as taking a stand for something. For 4 years, I have been waiting for Labour to articulate leadership and take a stand against the rampant fraud, corruption, lies, heist of British democracy and I have been disappointed each and every time. No-one had the gumption to stand for what was right & just (and the Liberal Democrats alone don't have the numbers). Labour is a party caught betwixt and between, didn't know which way to turn and so disappointed everyone. For better or worse, at least Johnson set out his stall & didn't retreat from it which I kind of respect (even as I find his agenda loathsome). Sometimes it is better to take a stand with pride or else you get run over in BOTH directions. Are the Liberal Democrats beginning to see a rekindling of their fortunes because, I observe, they don't seem to have lost any of their pro-European ardour? \n",

      "So absorbed in his own ideologies, and well-intentioned as they may have been, he was simply not astute enough to read enough of the country's mood and \"feelings\" effectively.\n",
      "Starmer is/was an excellent lawyer, but he has a number of problems that prevent the post-Corbyn relaunch that Labour needs from taking shape.\n",
      "For one thing, he's dull and wooden. Forensics, however accurate and trenchant, don't make headlines, and politics is as much about sales-making as it is of policy and purpose.\n",
      "The sad fact is that Johnson's persona plays well, and goes far enough, with enough people (thanks in large part to the propaganda from the toilet paper press of course, the equivalent of which Labour do not enjoy) to mean that pointing out his disgraces becomes very dull to a lot of people who both know and accept him as a disgraceful person but a captivating political figure--our own Trump indeed.\n",
      "For another thing, Starmer inherited a party that was not just reeling from its worst electoral performance in eons, but which was also internally and antagonistically riven--not a strong hand to try and play when you've just come into the game.\n",
      "For a third thing, the success of the vaccine rollout has allowed a myriad of Tory/Johnson sins--including the prior handling of the pandemic itself, which was world-beating awful--to be overlooked if not forgiven. \n",
      "Starmer can't trash the vaccine rollout nor would he, and the implicit question--what's worth caring about more, safeguarding the public effectively from the worst pandemic in over 100 years, or who picked up the tab for what is, at the end of the day, wallpaper?--seems to have only one answer to probably the majority of people.\n",

      "People arguing that voters need to just accept the mighty savour of the centre ground that is Starmer and stop voting against their best interests is a huge part of the problem. It demonstrates the division between the majority of the electorate and the high-and-mighty, self-appointed \"intellectuals\" and until the latter accepts that people don't enjoy being spoken down to then nothing will change.What do Labour stand for right now aside from being \"not the Conservatives\"?Can you blame people for voting in favour of a known entity as opposed to the man who spouts words like \"sleaze\" every four minutes and expects normal, working class voters to care? I mean, yes, of course you can blame them but to what end? Offer voters a reason to vote for you and not a reason to not vote for the Conservatives and maybe we'll get somewhere.What these comments mostly demonstrate to me is that Labour voters want to change the electoral system so their party stands a chance and not propose any ideas that can actually win with the system we do have, as well as to talk down to voters in a misguided hope they'll change as opposed to understanding what they do actually want from their political leaders.It's all well and good being on the correct side of the argument but until we collectively accept that voters don't want to be told they're wrong, we'll get nowhere. The tactics used by the SNP in Scotland offer an idea of what works: talk to voters as if they are real people facing real issues (which they are) and not as some amorphous entity who need to open their eyes and accept your way of thinking. You can shape the discussion but it has to be done from a place of respect for the electorate and not from a mentality of \"when will these idiots wake up and accept my point of view?!\"Labour are demonstrably terrible at winning elections and it's not because they're on the wrong side of the argument but because of the way they present their arguments. You can't be the party of working people while simultaneously treating working people like fools.\n",

      "I am centrist Labour voter and I agree with a lot of what you have said. The liberal elite subscribe to progressive politics and what the right class as 'woke' culture. There has always been conservative resistance against social progress but social media has condensed the duration of both the change and the inevitable backlash. The young are pushing for an inclusive society and a lot of different issues are fighting for airtime so it feels relentless to a lot of people who are not invested in change, be it due to age, political leanings or socioeconomic background. These issues are important (poverty, race, gender, sexism) so they amplify emotion and negative discourse and this results in polarization. The harsh reality is that yes a lot of liberals are arrogant when it comes to the moral ground. This is because a lot of these issues are reduced to informed debate at the dinner table in comfortable secure lives. That context doesn't change the validity of the argument but it does undermine Labour's ability to maintain their working class roots. The Brexit vote has demonstrated that Labour isn't really a left wing party anymore, a lot of their voters who consider themselves left wing just aren't. With issues around race, poverty & gender 'disagreeing' is often used to resist progress and mask prejudice but not always - identifying that distinction is hard and polarizes on both sides of the table. Loads of people have an adorable but slightly racist nan though so progress is visible. Currently we are a democratic Tory nation. It's your time and assuming from your post you're a moderate so I'd be interested in your opinion of this government. For us aging (38) liberals we just have to watch in horror from the sidelines and hope the young hide in the cities until it's their turn to drive. Looking at the 40-50 bracket in recent elections it's not as encouraging as it once was. I guess Scotland might get a huge influx of young progressives in a decades time. Who knows. Anyway I hope you're safe and well.\n",

      "\n",
      "Oh thank bollocks, finally someone who gets it. Every comment I've posted on this site about Starmer being a wet blanket in calling out Tory failures inevitably attracts a \"but he did well at PMQs yesterday\" comment. The only people who actually care about PMQs are the elderly (who are predominantly Tory voters anyway) and (apparently) Guardian editors and commentators. Since PMQs are the only place where Starmer ever seems to do anything, no wonder no voters know or care about him.\n",
      "I'd hoped Starmer would be the force to drive Labour back to the top but it's become very clear he's far more of an administrator than a leader. And that's fine, because the nation needs competent administrators, but what Labour needs is a leader - a firebrand who will attack the Tories at every possibility, bothering them incessantly like a dog worrying a bone until they slip up, at which point said leader pounces on that slip-up to impose even more suffering. Such a leader would never have allowed the £58,000 flat scandal to fade away in a week; such a leader would have forced the responsible Prime Minister's resignation.\n",
      "I don't know where Labour is going to find such a leader, but it's become abundantly clear that its current crop of \"leadership\" is stuck in the days when politics was a gentleman's game. The Tories have made it into something far uglier, and until or unless Labour is willing to (a) admit this (b) start promoting people who aren't afraid to fight a little dirty, the party is going to continue to lose.\n",
      "Moral superiority is fine and good, but it doesn't win elections - it's time for Labour to wake up. The question is, are they even capable of it at this point? Or is the party that brought social welfare, a vision of a better future, to the UK - destined to fade away while quietly muttering that \"it's not fair\"?\n",

      "Sorry but this is an opinion not an an analysis and it is analysis that is needed now more than ever. We need to map out how the various - and nefarious - Conservative interventions in the democratic process have done what they were intended to do - i.e. keep the party in power and vested interest protected. Firstly, the (continuing) gerrymandering of constituency boundaries so that one that was previously Labour held by Labour has had a large predominantly Tory voting area incorporated into it. Boundaries all over the UK have been redrawn in their favour. Secondly, pork barrel politics, giving the impression that it is as a result of the local Tory MP's efforts that government largesse has been won for a particular town or city. Thirdly, the converse of that, the belief that by not voting Tory government, the constituency will be punished and money will go elsewhere. Fourthly, the timing of the release of actions, information or Covid regulations to fit nicely within an election timetable for the benefit of the Conservatives - why was there a delay in officially releasing the news about the fears about the many India variants now in the UK? Fifthly, the trumpeting of opinion poll results, often from unscientifically accepted sample sizes and companies set up by Conservatives.Then there is of course the media, and for many journalists covering elections is to be framed as a knockabout with some scraping rock bottom in their shoddy vox pop interviews which lack follow-up questions that might pierce some of the common-sensical responses such as, in response to voting for Johnson, '\"Well, he's a larf isn't he.'Corruption is not being called out for what it is and the silence on this is helping build the road to something very dangerous. I vote Labour, am no fan of Starmer but we really do need need more than simplistic dismissals of the losing Party and an examination of the machinations of the Conservative approach to democratic procedure.\n",

      "There have been two significant GE loses for Labour in my lifetime - Foot and Corbyn. The only reason Corbyn did reasonably well first time round was because the electorate hadn't gotten to know him well enough and May was hopeless. Once the electorate realised how far left Corbyn was and the rubbish that came out of the mouths of Abbot, Momentum and McClusky that was enough. We don't live in a highly industrialised country anymore, digging for coal or making steel, from which Labour would get its support. Since the early 80's the country has moved away from wanting far left policies. Labour needs to modernise and create centre left policies that are fit for the times we live in and where the future lies. That means not automatically condemning people who have high income and if that wealth has been created from running good business's that treat their customers and staff well they are entitled to that wealth. Yes go after the wealthy if they have created the wealth on the back of greed. But I always find it a bit two faced of McCluskey in particular given he doesn't do bad out of his union. And then yes, create modern policies to help those in need but also don't be shy about dealing with those in need who could also do more for themselves. There is a moral duty to the rest of society to only claim state help when it is needed and not instead of working and earning when perfectly capable of doing so - just as there is a moral duty to the rich end of society to be prepared to help those in genuine need and to look after those not as fortunate as themselves. Starmer deserves to be cut some slack given he has only been in the job just over a year and because of the pandemic. But he now needs to start providing a vision of what he is about and what Labour can do for the people. I am sick of hearing Labour MP's when asked about what they would do and the answer is \"we will wait to see what the Tories propose\"\n",

Mansfield has gone from +11.3% Lab to +33.1% Con, virtually the same thing in Dudley (11% Lab to 31.5% Con), while Bolsover has gone from +26.8% Lab to +11.5% Con. There's various other 30+ point swings away from Labour in Stoke on Trent South, Walsall North, Great Grimsby and Ashfield.\n",

      "Fair enough you've made the point that doesn't seem to be working for Keir, and it didn't work for Jeremy, but I am not sure if you are proposing anything? It seems to me that what used to be a party for the working class is not working anymore, not least because the working class, at least as it used to be constituted, no longer exists. The working class are in China, Vietnam and the Philippines, assembling your smartphones and sewing your jeans, and the liberation/paradise that Marx considered when looking at 19th century working conditions, is probably not so far from modern day Europe (certainly nothing to do with the totalitarian hell holes that emerged under communism).In the absence of a working class, the \"electoral market\" that Labour tries to represent are social democratic middle classes, non-university educated workers, unions and unionised workers, \"radical\" middle classes (students, trots), and the diverse BAME communities. As you point out, it's hard to find a common thread in all that. The answer should be Labour splitting into 2 or more parts and an electoral system capable of representing medium size parties not just larger ones. Whilst the conservatives will want to keep FPTP, it will be untenable; Scotland has shown that by the time a party represents 50% of the electorate they are attributed close to 100% of the seats. The electoral system is a tough one, it is hard to trust politicians with such a task given their vested interests, though we could start by looking at Scotland, whose electoral system seem pretty good with a mix of constituency and proportionally elected MSPs. And a reminder that how the second chamber is constituted is not such a big deal as long as the first chamber has absolute primacy.\n"

      "Starmers main problem is that he is seen as a career politician. He does not seem to have any core principles or convictions. This leads to him being unable to clearly communicate his vision of what he wants to do. Then his reliance on focus groups and latching on to things like flag-waving just make him look like a chancer who will say anything to get a vote. Personally he is boring and dull which does not help.Also the Tories have had a year of daily briefings which they have used as political broadcasts, the press and media have given them an easy ride on their incompetence and Kier has failed to criticise them when he had the chance, with people saying you should not play politics in a pandemic. Yeah just imagine the Tory party, press and media if a Labour Government had done the exact same things at every step of the pandemic as this government. Would be a tirade of criticism and we know it.The final thing is amess said blatantly that tories favour their own constituencies when in government, this is corrupt but it is how they always operate and many towns and cities that did not get much benefit in the past have now thought well we'll see if we get anything by voting with them. I think they will end up disappointed but that is where we are.Given the pandemic will be here for a while , **VACC**ines are rolling out well and economic predictions are good, the tories will likely give a few sops to marginal seats hog the news bulletins and still be ahead at next GE.

      "Johnson, meanwhile, emboldened titanicallly by this outcome will press even harder now for Parliament to bin the FTPA. He will go to the country next year, either in the Spring or the Autumn.

The next general election is years away, Labour have plenty of time to work on their messaging and Starmer to work on his bedside manner and relatability. But Labour HAVE to move back to the worries of white, middle aged Britons, the ones who turn out to vote. He needs to stop bashing the UK, he needs to automatically stop opposing every single thing the Tories do, and he needs to stop worrying about stuff most voters don't care very much about - Boris paying for renovation, asking for his nanny to be paid by supporters, etc. Yes, Boris is corrupt & he lies a lot - but most voters simply are not bothered.

There's nowhere for them to go without a complete rebrand. They can't move to a more socially right-wing position as young people will desert them for the greens. They can't move further economically left-wing as the government is already paying the salaries of half the country (there's very little space to go) and whilst the policies themselves are popular, the public don't trust them to deliver them. Brexit haunts them; traditional 'red-wall' voters still mostly back it, whereas their younger voters see it as a disaster. \n",
      "Starmer isn't great, sure, but you have to remember that Corbyn was utterly annihilated not very long ago. It's not a leadership issue, it's a combination of Labour's structural issues and the unfavourable time to be in opposition. The economy is rebounding, the **VACC**ine rollout (while not the government's doing) is going brilliantly and the public have faith that the world will still return to normal. During covid, any attack on the government was seen as petty, as the public seemed to believe the government were doing their best.

Although I would of liked Starmer to have been far more vocal during the past 14 months with regard not just to the pandemic response but for the chaos that is Brexit, the blatant dodgy contracts, the people forced to use food banks, children going hungry and not having the resources to study at home, changing laws/protecting statues, the atrocious 1% NHS pay rise, 50% cut to arts education, I do appreciate it was a difficult time to be the opposition when most people were focused on avoiding the virus and the tragic deaths of loved ones.

      "Predictable result given the high Brexit Party poll in 2019, not particularly a sign of further Tory Red Wall invasion, although Labour imagining that ' trendy' national themes and attacks on the Tories would cut it on the doorstep rather than practical attention to local issues is worrying for the future. Because of CoVid emergency suspension of normal politics, Brexit amnesia, and as yet incomplete policy revision, Labour won't mobilise massively at the moment and there was never a way UKIPpers were going to be rallied to it at the moment. Even without **VACC**ine bounce and demonstrable Brexit benefits the Tories will continue to harvest UKIP sentiment until Labour gets its act together, if it can. Reaching over the side to haul the 'culturally conservative' back in the boat threatens to capsize the lot, and for what. According to M Goodwin et al, impossible for Labour to appeal to metropolitan individualists and parochial communitarians at once (although Boris can appeal to each and everyone?) What's needed is a more nuanced and differentiated address, which speaks to communities in their own terms, as did not happen in Hartlepool. It's not all about policy.\n",

Boris is strong on narrative, weak on facts. Boris constantly pans out towards a larger feel good narrative in which the Brexit he delivered is allegedly helping the **VACC**ine rollout and Freeports. He also throws in other achievements.

      "There is no doubt that Starmer is a far better man than Boris Johnson, or that many Labour policies are vastly superior to the Tory's. But Starmer has a mountain to climb because of Jeremy Corbyn, the centre- hard left split in the party, a totally inadequate deputy leader, the fact that they are still, after all this time, sitting on the brexit fence and because the full effects of a disastrous decision to depart the EU hasn't hit home yet in places such as Hartlepool. Once all these things have bedded down, and austerity hits home in the northern blue line areas of the country, things will start to turn in Starmer's direction. The two factors which led to this big swing to the Tories in Hartlepool were both humongous errors of judgement by the people there. They will very quickly regret voting Tory. Firstly because the successful **VACC**ine rollout had little or nothing to do with them, and secondly because austerity will lead to them being far worse off, very soon.\n",

      "Even assuming the UK's **VACC**ination success can be attributed to having left the EU, and even assuming that as a fully-committed EU member the UK didn't succeed in getting the other member states to adopt its own more pragmatic Anglo Saxon approach so that *everyone* got **VACC**inated earlier (on past performance, by far the most likely outcome, given that the UK nearly always got its way as an EU member), and even assuming that the EU hasn't learned from its mistakes this time around, that's still an odd viewpoint. Global pandemics don't come around that often, at least not in the developed world. The last one was a century ago.\n",
      "So the argument boils down to \"by leaving the EU we've ensured that we'll get **VACC**inated quicker once every 100 years. The next time we get this benefit almost everybody who's alive today will be dead.\" It's a bit thin, no?\n",

Another thing voters have always liked about him is his focus on action, whether it’s building more homes in London, greenlighting HS2 or getting Brexit done. The latest addition to the list is the successful **VACC**ine roll out and it was clearly this – and not talk of Westminster wallpaper – that was ringing in the ears of voters when they went to the polls.\n",
      "The challenge that lies ahead is one of delivery. BoJo has three years to show his newfound supporters that he has made good on his promises. Guiding the economy through a turbulent Covid recovery, delivering on the levelling up agenda and making significant progress on net zero will all be crucial. If he delivers on these, he'll win in 2023/4 and there's nothing Labour can do about it.\n",

The country, and I am astounded by it, seems to forgive the serial failures in the Tory Party as a result of one lucky gamble, that could easily have gone wrong.\n",
