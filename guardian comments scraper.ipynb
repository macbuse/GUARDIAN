      "When politicians cite Covid-19 statistics, they may be wrong – it doesn't mean the numbers are,\n",
      "Well, I take two issue with the headline. First, politicians and media pundits are often cherry picking statistics to create narratives, frame certain topics and suggest solutions. If the UK Statistics Authority would have ensured that the wide public can access statistics that have been independently validated, maybe many toxic narratives would have been easier to debunk, wether the topic is our EU membership, taxes, trade and geopolitical relations, education, healthcare or immigration, or anything else.\n",
      "If numbers would always be right, the way how they are aggregated would't be subject to arbitrary formulae and bias, then people would be in a better place to make informed choices. But they aren't.\n",
      "Second, the recent public outrage in relation to numbers, formulae and computer modelling used to measure educational attainment has demonstrated that scrutinising the validity of \"numbers\" is not as straightforward as David and those who place a lot of weight on analysing numbers and ML like to claim. Moreover, as the RSS has repeatedly argued, we don't register deaths timely and properly in England and Wales, which makes it rather challenging to interpret data like for example the number of suicides per capita, by gender and age group, or deaths due to car accidents or as an outcome of domestic violence or other types of crime. WE don't even know officially, how many deaths are recorded late, as that is subject to FOI.\n",
      "In regards, to the numbers used by politicians and different pundits to measure, communicate and manage this public health crisis, unfortunately they are neither proper or timely, even when we look at the number of deaths or the processes designed to decide when should a death be recorded as having as primary cause Covid-19 or not. Is it 100% objective to decide if someone has died from Covid-19 within 28 days or longer after they were diagnosed? No. It is subject to a process, interpretation, and even personal bias.\n",
      "At the best of times, trust is a precious commodity, and during a crisis its importance is crucial as it can enable our leaders to take the public with them and manage the situation in an effective and safe way, with minimal losses. \n",
      "The fact that we are increasingly polarised and divided is not something that was brought on by this public health crisis, but by the habit of those in public office and corporate life to keep throwing around numbers and statistics which are carefully calibrated and aligned to match their ideology and agenda.\n",
      "Nothing is risk free in life. We do not know how long or short our lives will be and we have less control over our lives than we might be ready to admit. In this respect , numbers and statistics can provide the support to inform decisions and balance potential harms and benefits. But that is valid only is there is no bias in how data was collected, aggregated and presented by statisticians.\n",
      "If data, numbers and national statistics in this country would have been bias free, timely and proper, then many things would be different, starting with our crooked and highly divisive voting system , the FPTP. \n",
      "If statisticians would take their responsibility of their jobs seriously, our public debate won't be as toxic, divisive and polarising. And it would' be so easy for disruptors to use tainted money, dark political ads and three-words-slogans to stoke up fear and hate.\n",
      "A high grasp of numeracy across the general population can ensure that more people know how to evaluate critically stories or claims that are maliciously or incompetently made by politicians and different pundits. Having high quality national statistics produced by independent organisations is crucial. What we have in this courtny is a love affair with cherry picking what it's worth to measure and manage, and clim to be open, accountable and transparent.\n",
      "David says: \"Numbers may not measure what you think they may be measuring, but they are rarely completely wrong.\" That is the same strategy employed by those who create narratives , control the tone of public debate and use unethical scientific methods to shape social attitudes and behaviour.\n",
      "Counting the dead should be a pretty easy task as long as it is done properly and timely. But breaking down the number of deaths by cause is still subject to bias and even political interference. Our vital statistics like the registration of new births were put on hold during this pandemic. Why, given that the overwhelming majority of births take place in hospitals?\n",

      "Well times have moved on and govs around the world ARE sensitive to unnecessary deaths. I prefer it! For winter flu.. UK has for years been vaccinating at risk groups. This year the target group is expanded. Many of those covid measures were taken to flatten the curve so that (under funded and resourced) NHS wasn't overwhelmed. Additionally many medics were retrained / refreshed in intensive care medicine.\n",
      "But.. From NHS burnout over covid, 40,000 death figure covid wasn't in any way imaginary. Ukgov spends £ Billions a year trying to avoid (upto now) say 100 public murders by terrorists a year. You prefer to save the money & let the terrorists kill? Worldwide govs have entered lock downs etc not just ukgov. But ukgovs weakness or errors are apparent over covid. Taiwan, s Korea, ozz, nz, Japan all have far lower deaths AND less economic damage. Taiwan for instance 7 covid deaths over the whole 8 months. Internally everything is open.. Saving the majority of their high street, restaurants etc. \n",
      "Ukgovs usual ploy of Nothing to see here, no one is available, oh look! A squirrel!, no comment.. Hasn't worked with covid since its not a one day / week event. Covid has exposed how stupid and inefficient ukgov is.. 11 u turns, lock down late, airports open til June when Philippines shut mid Feb (&that's not listed as a u turn!!) , masks (OK face coverings since stupid ukgov doesn't manufacture anything, I spite of 2008 & now covid where it is apparent just how little UK manufactures) asia since day 1, ukgov 6 months late. So ukgov could have simply copied other countries months ago.. But didn't. The 'following the science' doesn't wash either.. Covid is 'new' the science is still being researched and decided as we speak 6 months later. Other countries got far better (saved lives and economic recovery) results following their science or.. Just from common sense! Taiwan and others put part of their covid success down to SARs experience. Which ukgov should also have learned from but obviously didn't. Also ukpublic, opposition, pressure groups need to engage and organise now, because once a covid vaccine arrives, ukgov will be able to go back to normal divide & conquer, no one was available etc ploys to railroad public back into..For instance commuting 2hrs a day to work for no reason. 5 day weeks when rotating 4 day (extended) weeks could get work done, reduce traffic, congestion, pollution and transport expansion pressures. Spending in high street to support what for decade pre covid was a known, dying event. You might have thought ukgov having had decade plus to prepare for high street etc demise.. Would have had a plan for retraining, new services or industries which while staff were furlough Ed at home, they could have part retrained on line over a few months. \n",

Pre covid biz were against homeworking Until the experiment was done and biz forced to change its mind. Online teaching could have been another experiment and eye opener. Why should the range of lessons be limited by school? Why should rate of learning be limited to school days, school hours, school terms? Why shouldn't oaps, prisons, adult learning have access to high quality teaching online at what ever dates (not just school terms), rates (French every hour of the day for 2 weeks straight), content subtitled and signed. \n",

      ".Perhaps the Public Accounts Committee and MP's ought to look very closely at the statistics used to support the already weakened business case for HS2, and the real data emerging from companies post Covid. The data would suggest a permanent rather than a temporary shift in working practice.The non- listening MP's continue to act blindly over HS2,, The incredible guff handed out by HS2 and Civil Servants to the Public Accounts Committee notwithstanding ostensibly lying about massive budget overruns, and the seriously questionable Shapps/ Oakervee Review we now have a radically altered situation Post Covid. In order to try and meet the widely accepted £100 Bn plus yet to be spent on HS2 no longer meeting any realistic business case, reduced speeds so less (theoretical business) time saved and radically reduced peak time capacity the reality is a market that is disappearing,for this line, rather than expenditure on the whole network.Outsourcing firm Capita is to close over a third of its offices in the UK permanently, announced today (BBC).The firm, which is a major government contractor, is to end its leases on almost 100 workplaces.\"Following dialogue with our 45000 employees it has become very clear that they would like to work in a more flexible way, which will involve increased working from home, but they will still spend a significant amount of their time working from offices that are based in the heart of our local communities.\"Exactly - but they are but one of 50 companies already assuring us that they intend to adopt the same principle. Why on earth would they not? Main boards have become aware that output is maintained by home working without a massive premises overhead, unnecessary meetings, and needless commuting.The technology for home networking will only improve and successful companies going forward will adopt this as the standard model.Business lobby group CBI has warned that the fall in office working is damaging city centre economies.\"No it is not, it is damaging commercial property values and support/ hospitality city services, and transferring the expenditure out of the centres.This is a permanent shift; all that remains to be answered is the degree, as the government tries to persuade everyone to return to the existing, now outdated, model. The same applies, even more so, to HS2 ; it's doubtful that MP's. of all parties will pay any attention. The build, build, build mantra from Boris is madness if its spend, spend, spend to no purpose and a clear waste.\n",

      "There are two issues here, at least. One is the clear communication of risk, and empowering personal decision-making about risk. The other is the goal of public policy.\n",
      "What should the goal of public policy have been? I think a very good case can be made that, especially at the incipient stages of an outbreak, the goal SHOULD be elimination, i.e., zero-Covid. I hasten to add that zero-Covid does not literally mean zero Covid, but numbers so low that contact tracing can fully contain any new epidemics.\n",
      "If you accept this goal, and you are of under no obligation to do so, then lockdown was not at all an unreasonable policy choice. There is, of course, a completely different policy goal, which is herd immunity. I believe it was extremely foolish to make this the initial goal, and it muddled a lot of policy-making as well as communication.\n",
      "How far have succeeded in achieving zero Covid? We have not done at all badly, actually. Daily death rates have come down from a few hundred at the peak to around ten. The doubling time for the total number of deaths has come down from 1-2 weeks at the peak to essentially infinity. So lockdown has been a success, by and large.\n",
      "Of course lockdown cannot be continued indefinitely. We have brought down the numbers to the point where, technically, it ought to be feasible to carry out contact tracing on every new outbreak. The real policy failure is that that capability has not been developed. That is why we are still having all these arguments about whether we can safely emerge from lockdown. \n",
      "If we had that capability, then it would genuinely be much less a public policy issue, and much more an issue of personal risk appetite (based on personal demographics). But in early March, it was entirely a public policy issue, and was botched for the first few weeks, though handled reasonably well thereafter.\n",

      "‘People tend to have an exaggerated sense of their vulnerability to Covid-19...’\n",
      "Quite possibly, yes. However, since the Cummings affair and the rather botched messaging around the easing fo restrictions that followed it, people feel they have to follow their own instincts to reduce their risk to the lowest possible level. No one feels they are being looked out for by anyone but themselves. Consequently, everyone is doing the maximum they feel necessary, spending on their own age, health and temperament. It doesn’t mean they overestimate risk, it just means we all feel a duty to ourselves and those who love us to do the max. \n",
      "In addition to this, we were in a fairly strict lockdown, so much of the data we are told to look at when assessing risk applies to circumstances that no longer pertain. Take, for example, the argument that schoolteachers are at no greater risk than any other member of the working public. How do we know? The only data of any relevance would be that covering Feb-March, and that’s a very small dataset. It could equally be the case that no profession has yet been exposed at anything like the level that teachers will be; prolonged close contact with large numbers in small and unventilated indoor spaces, without PPE. Feasibly, that could mean teachers face a far greater risk than medical professionals who have PPE, and probably equal to medics in the early days when PPE was not available. \n",
      "Finally, a ton of data just doesn’t exist. Apart from the Imperial symptom app study, very little exists on Long Covid in non hospitalised cases. Most working age people know they probably won’t be hospitalised, but what they don’t know is if they will ever be the same again if they catch it. So, again, you have to apply the precautionary principle and assume there’s a high probability that it will disable you.\n",

If the last few months have taught us anything it is that there is actual a profound social and political reason for challenging the quality of statistical education in this country.\n",

Saying \"it's alright, I was crap at Maths\" is far too commonplace. Yet the same parent would hide any equivalent literacy skills.

Doing so does not need to be at the expense of methodological rigour either. \n",

That’s why the statistical community let out a collective gasp last Sunday when Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the US Food and Drug Administration, told a press conference that treatment with convalescent plasma would mean that of “100 people who were sick with Covid-19, 35 would have been saved”. If true, this would be one of the most remarkable medical discoveries in history, saving one life for every three people treated. But it is completely false. In fact 13.7% of the treated group died, compared with 8.9% of a comparison group, a 35% relative difference. The absolute difference was 5%, so if we believed the figures, in fact 20 people had to be treated to save one life. But we should not even believe those numbers, being based on selected patients receiving the treatment, and not comparing like with like in a proper randomised design.\n",

      "Yes, you are right about that. But there is another confounding issue coming along. Much more testing is being done and (in Scotland at any rate) positive tests seem to be coming in at around, or less than 1% of those tested.\n",
      "This gives us the false positive problem. So far as I know, from what I have read, the specificity of the Covid PCR test is usually quoted as 99.5%. The specificity is the proportion of patients without the disease that correctly test negative - the remainder are false positives, ie patients without the disease who nevertheless have a positive test. \n",
      "Think about it like this. Say you test 1000 people who do not have Covid. Five of them will test positive. So if your are screening a population, and get positive test results of around 1%, you can expect that around half of these will truly have Covid and around half will not. But at the time of testing you simply won't know. When the disease has prevalence at this sort of level false positives are inevitable and will elevate the reported prevalence to as much as twice the true prevalence. \n",
      "Conversely, the sensitivity (proportion of patients with the disease who test positive) is said to be around 70%, so if you get an outbreak your problem is false negative results. Say there is a cluster and you test 200 people, of which 70 have a positive test. In this case there will be around 30 infected people who were not identified by the test (and in this group theoretically one false negative).\n",
      "So we must be very careful when local outbreaks lead to mass testing, as it s likely that even when the outbreak is under control, continued mass testing will give lots of positive results in people who do not have covid. Not an easy scenario is it?\n",

The rate of spread can be moderated, and that's the only thing the govt can influence, as it's a virus and medical practitioners can't offer a cure, once infected. That's a fact. \n",

In addition one risks a car crash, or a plane crashing. One risks being hit by a tree, or being stabbed in the street.\n",

      "What you need is a statistical actuary model of how likely a given group of people was to die within a given 28 day period after a positive Covid test , then compare that with your actual measured mortality rate within 28 days. See how good your model is, by testing it.\n",
      "You would do what all actuary` do, you cannot predict how long a given person will live, but given a big enough sample their average life expectancy can be calculated. With Covid-19 `victims` you look at how many in a given group are at any given age 30-40, 41-50 etc, work out from that the average life expectancy for a given group of people of different ages etc, on average. From that working out the probability of any given member, at random, dying within a 28 day period is easy, for a big enough sample size. \n",
      "So, you get the odds of dying within a 28 day period, of two groups. The group of those who test positive for Covid, against a carefully matched `equivalent` (age ranges, general health etc) group, not tested at all. A third group, tested but negative, would also then further tell you how good the tests, really were?\n",
      "That tells you the extra rick of a positive Covid-19 positive test. For really large groups, you can use not the average odds of dying within 28 days, but the number - on average - predicated to die within 28 days. As an example if eight were predicted to die, without testing, within 28 days, yet 22 die after positive tests, you are in serious trouble, the death rate has more than doubled, nearly trebled in fact!\n",

      "There's seclection pressure for more infectious versions. And in highly lethal infections (tens of percent mortality) for lower lethality. But this virus mostly kills people past breeding age who are not very socially active. And it's passed on before symptoms appear. So there will be very little selection pressure for less fatal strains. It kills the people that don't matter for its transmission, or the people that do matter but after it's been transmitted. That's why it transmits so well despite being much more lethal than flu. And a 1% infection fatality rate means it will make no serious impact on the size of the host pool. This is not like Ebola, where half of those infected die (although they can pass it on after death, so again there's little selection pressure to become less lethal).\n",

      "There have been a few suicides because of the lockdown and whilst you could argue that they were Covid-related these people did not die of Covid. In addition to that - if you look at the correlation and offset of reported infections and reported deaths in the UK, France and Spain you will notice that despite infections apparently increasing (drastically in some cases) there does not seem to be a correlating increase in the number of fatalities as had happened with the first wave. It was also reported that there was a significant number of excess deaths at home and not in hospital - these are people who can't or won't go to hospital - for whatever reason.\n",
      "So, your blanket statement is rather unhelpful in actually understanding what happened.

      "The statisticians are doing an excellent job across the world, but it is striking how little attention is paid in the UK to a key statistic, that of excess deaths per million. This measure, and particularly when adjusted to a standardised spread of age, is internationally recognised as the best measure of the impact of the virus. The virus is an indirect as well as direct killer. The fact is that people are dying earlier than would otherwise be the case because, for example, of postponed cancer treatment as hospitals risk being overrun .For excess deaths per million, up to a date when data is reasonably widely available (it takes administrative time to record and report deaths), the UK is second only to Spain in the extent of the impact of the virus, and once the age profile is taken into account, the UK is the worst. Interestingly the much maligned USA is mid-table - note the significance of the size of its population - and China is exceptionally robust.\n",
      "Of course there could be many reasons why a country struggles to cope more than another - density of population is one that the UK can point to - but another very clear outcome of the study of this data is that the excess death rate is closely correlated to the number infections present in the population prior to initial lockdown. That points the finger directly at the UK government's failure to act promptly.\n",

In the U.S, with 183,000 plus dead and with the numbers piling up, one would have to be 'putting your head in the ground' not to be concerned. As outbreaks recur, recently now in Spain and in Korea, the message that the Pandemic is 'in the rear-view mirror' is only to be seen as satisfactory by those who do not want to know.We should be able to trust in the government, but with information as free as it is to the Public, perhaps excepting in China and Russia with their Internet systems 'protected', there is plenty of an ability for at least those willing to seek information to find what they will. Politicians should certainly be honest, but I would ask: In the U.S, how many people would willingly tolerate 180,000 dead in 7 months from a war and yet accept it from a viral Pandemic? How many in the UK would accept nearly 42,000 dead from the same war?

Wearing face masks by well-people interacting with well members of the public (either occupationally or otherwise) is not recommended....... Members noted that the evidence for [mask] use is very weak and limited for those with prolonged contact with symptomatic individuals in the same household. The evidence for [mask] use in the general public is near nil.\"\n",
      "From April;\n",
      "\"Evidence does not currently support use of face masks to protect the wearer in the general population.....\n",
      "\"The effect of wearing face masks is weak, likely to be small.....\n",
      "Into May, no mention of masks at the meetings.\n",
      "Right up until the laughable, \"The transport secretary announces that face coverings will be mandatory on public transport in England, from 15 June. He said these face coverings should not be surgical masks but things like homemade masks or scarves......\"\n",
      "The latter, not only contrary to the actual evidence, is even more moronic given that any evidence supporting the wearing of masks relates specifically to the type of mask and its correct use (clue, it ain't homemade or scarves).\n",
      "Compulsory face coverings are a purely political decision with nothing to back it up.\n",

      "I’ve stayed away from empirical arguments about data. Because while accepting the author’s excellent point that the numbers don’t speak for themselves but are “imbued with meaning” a posteriori, whether Covid is 20% worse or 20% less worse than they suggest, ethical questions would remain about how these interventions are affecting our society, economy, culture, mental well-being and, indeed, physical wellbeing. People die from other things but Covid. People’s immune systems are compromised by stress and isolation.\n",
      "In sum, we are becoming a society fixated on Covid at the expense of all other concerns. Saving life cannot be the overriding concern of our societies. All the time people choose quality of life over longevity. People sacrifice their lives for liberty and justice. Questions of quality of life and freedom - not freedom in some capitalist libertarian sense but of the most fundamental existential nature - have been outlawed.\n",
      "During previous pandemics these extreme measures were not imposed. Elections were not postponed. Fundamental rights, such as to a state education, were not suspended. This suggests that Covid - or the fear of Covid - exists partially in the current cultural imagination - one of disintegrating capitalist societies being held together by nothing but fear.\n"

Deliberately organising **RIOT**s in blue states using careful manipulation is something I don't think Donald is capable of and Bannon is currently on bail. The approach may work. The MAGA convoys firing paint guns conceals the fact that those in BLM know what they really would like to be firing. Thats the degree of antipathy that has to be overcome.\n",
