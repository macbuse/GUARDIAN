      "As a member of an indigenous nation colonised by the British, I have an interest in these issues. 'The Crown' did give an apology, but to be honest, it meant little because it didn't actually do anything to reverse the situation that had been created when the British Red Coats swept in. My people were fortunate not to be slaughtered or besieged but many others were not so lucky. The Red Coats invaded a neighbouring tribe, murdering, raping women and children, burning the homes to the ground and destroying crops, and pushing families into starvation. Let me add here that these were peaceful villages whose only crime was to refuse to move from their lands when the Crown wanted to take them so that the region could be 'opened up' for settlement - ie, that the resources could be stolen by the British to fund their empire and the land turned over to speculators and developers. My own people were left diseased, starving, landless and forced into a subsistence living by providing a pool of poorly paid, cheap, seasonal labour for settlers. If anyone went to Parliament to try and alleviate the situation, settler and business lobby groups would scream and say this was all for our own good and it would 'ruin the economy' if we were to receive any meaningful legal protections for what we had left, which was previous little. On top of this, it was all, apparently, our own fault and if only we worked harder and lived more like the British, all our problems would go away. Apology? Who cares, words are cheap and easy. Actually doing something is what is required - it may be, for example, teaching this history in schools, funding scholarships, partnerships to rehabilitate our lands that have been abused and polluted for so long after the forests were razed and our beautiful lakes drained for farming. The British cut down every single tree and set fire to what was left, all to fund 'the Empire'. I don't hold any animosity for what happened, only sadness, but there is such a thing as righting the wrongs of the past. These are tangible today - there have been many studies that have traced current problems to what happened back in the day. It wasn't a short process either, even 100 years after the first British came to take the land for themselves, many of the indigenous people were still living subsistence livelihood, ravaged by European diseases, not in any small part due to starvation and poor living conditions. The Government, just as the Crown, simply refused any real solution, fearful of upsetting the lobby groups of the 'haves' by being seen to favour the 'have nots'. So they let people die. You might find it surprising then that I'm in two minds about tearing down statues. I see the reasons for tearing them down but I also see the reasons for keeping them up. Tearing down means erasure, but is that what is needed? Just because there's a statue doesn't mean it has to be revered, or reviled, for that matter, and if we take it away, is a piece of the past less accessible? I would be inclined to leave it up, but tell the unvarnished truth. Explain why the statue was put there and how people thought when it was put up, and how people think about it now. Being from a people whose past has been consistently denied, I see the value in claiming the past - all of it - and using the icons of the past to teach new lessons - and perhaps old ones.\n",

      "Well, what we really need to consider is, what about taking down Colston’s statue to people really object to?\n",
      "1. Is it the destruction of history? Of course not. Could the average person tell you who Samuel Morley, once the Liberal MP for Bristol is, since there is a statue of him up in Bristol? Or Edmund Burke? I think it’s unlikely and if people did know anything about those figures, they’d know that they were great abolitionists and as much a part of our history as Colston and surely, by their logic, they would know about them? \n",
      "2. Is it about the law? The average person, me included, knows nothing about law. So the idea that conservative MPs or members of the public understand this trial better than the JURY MEMBERS who overwhelmingly voted not guilty, is unlikely, if not ludicrous.\n",
      "3. It’s about identity. People in Bristol were taught for decades that Colston was a kind benefactor (influenced significantly by the Merchant Venturers who refused to have Colston’s misleading plaque changed) and British people have been taught that the empire and Britain was always a great, glorious thing. It is now clear that, despite being a philanthropist to the non-catholic children of Bristol, there was certainly a lot more to Colston than that and that Britaing has often behaved very badly — and the world is shaped by that history. Conservatives can’t cope with that — to them, all British history is glorious and when it isn’t, it’s because people apparently had no moral fibre back then.

There is plenty of evidence that people who tried to tackle the powerful and wealthy were killed (Peterloo), incarcerated (transported to Australia) or severely punished (imprisoned for being in debt, or stealing food), women were raped (Droit de seigneur) and men made to work in appallingly unsafe conditions (factories, mines…) or go to war to fight battles they had no interest in winning.\n",

      "Very hard to get an unbiased view of Cromwell, who was both one of our greatest men and a man who in some ways failed to transcend what was bad in his society. The Irish massacres for which he was responsible happened, but they were limited, they were within the laws of war as then understood, and they took place in the context of a lot of previous violence - Cromwell no doubt believed too unquestioningly the stories of Irish atrocities and finally they need to be seen in the context of the violence in all parts of the countries. Think of the deaths in Leicester, or the population of Bristol abused by Rupert, or a town like Newark, ravaged by plague as a direct result of the wars. The Irish suffered during this period, but they were not the only peole to suffer.If you have been brought up to hate Cromwell, I pity you, but take comfort. Charles II, a man notable for having a moral compass no higher than that of our current PM, decreed that the key vengeance after the Restoration should be taken out on Cromwell's body, which was ritually dug up and insulted.

      "It's my understanding that the statue to Colston was erected in celebration of his philanthropic deeds, undertaken by Colston after he divested himself of his slavery interests/shares in the Royal Africa Company (a company established/headed by the brother of Charles II, later James II) - which Colston had sold to, then, William of Orange (later King). As such, it seems that Colston took the profits from his sins, and used them for good (not, in the main, towards the victims of the Company he had interests in, admittedly) - unlike the British Royal Family, who acquired his shares in the slave company and whose largesse was limited to themselves and their families. Accordingly, whilst I'd like to have seen the statue to Colston stay in place (there's more joy in heaven for one sinner that repents etc.), I'd be quite happy for any statues of James II or King Billy to be toppled as, as far as I'm aware, unlike Colston, they never did any good with the blood money they - or their descendants - came into.\n",

Perhaps descendents of the Moroccans or the Moroccan Government who destroyed the stable West African Songhai Empire leading to internecine warfare and tribal slaves as war booty just before the Portuguese arrived to trade are the root of the West African slave trade? Of course not. Presumably the large Brazilian community domiciled in the UK aren't guilty though it would be absurd to start dividing them into Portuguese ancestry groups- more likely to have exploited slaves? Legally this is nonsensical. Of course as much history as possible should be studied- the sorry tale of oppression everywhere.

When we did abolish slavery we compensated slave owners but not the slaves. That’s not actually quite the humanitarian act we try to make out. We glorify white men and women who campaigned to end the slave trade but most adults know little or nothing about how we treated slave revolts or the the role literature from freed slaves played in educating the public. The story of the slave ship Zong is known by most young people but not most adults. Slaves thrown overboard simply to enable an insurance claim. Lies told in court to further that claim. Stories like that were forgotten yet Coulson glorified for how he spent the money he made from slavery. We fool ourselves about the kind of people we were in the 18th century.

On one level we all have as slavery essentially kick-started the Industrial Revolution and the continued existence of Empire benefited the country in trade terms right up until the 20th century. For a specifically Welsh perspective the colonialism report from the National Trust makes interesting reading. In the 18th century the owner of the Penrhyn Estate massively profited from slave plantations in Jamaica. He then ploughed that money into his agricultural estate and the local port and slate quarry.
