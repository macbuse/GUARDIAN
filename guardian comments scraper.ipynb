      "The people arguing in defence of the far right on this page are full of nonsense. \n",
      "They are right that there are indeed many left wing sympathies to be had for ‘far right’ positions — after all reducing immigration is an effective way of preventing scab labour, keeping wages high by controlling Labour supply. Equally, cultural assimilation of immigrants, without oppressively demanding they abandon their customs, is important for national cohesion well. Not wanting immigrants bringing medieval social views into your secular liberal democracy is hardly unreasonable. Pre-New Labour leftist governments actually kept immigration very low for these legitimate reasons. \n",
      "But far right voters aren’t voting for these reasons. They aren’t arguing for trade unions, social solidarity and social liberalism, they are voting for right wing parties that consciously attack workers rights, trade unions and sow division between majorities and minorities constantly. They aren’t even conservatives — they attack international law, the judiciary, electoral institutions and various other democratic bodies constantly.\n",
      "Even their reasons for their bigotry are contradictory. In France, traditional French secularism is weaponised to attack Muslims for just living their lives (ie wearing a Burkini). Whatever you think about Islamic traditions, the principle of secularism is that the government shouldn’t suppress individual religious practices, simply keep the threat of organised religion out of national politics. This militant secularism is authoritarianism, not liberalism. \n",
      "In Hungary, Poland and increasingly the United States, on the other hand, Christian nationalism is the ideology, attacking both the ‘morally decadent’, secular, liberal West and Muslim ‘invaders’. They, like the Muslim authoritarians they criticise, pick constantly on sexual minorities, racial minorities (ie the Roma, Mexicans), transgenders, whatever. They argue for national cohesion, while destroying it at every turn.\n",
      "Equally, demographically these extremists are contradictory. Here in the United Kingdom, our racists are broadly elderly. I remember during the Brexit campaign, many elderly friends of my Irish grandparent celebrating that she would ‘get sent back to where she came from’ and spewing other anti-immigrant bile. Our racists are Gillian Duffy types, whinging about ‘Eastern Europeans’ until they reach a certain age, and those same immigrants are suddenly wiping their bottoms. They aren’t necessarily badly off — they are homeowners, they (until recently) had their triple lock and, as the largest demographic voting bloc, are pandered to at every turn. Somehow, they still have grievances. In France, on the other hand, Marine Le Pen is most popular in the youngest voter group, under 30’s. She recently proposed that under her rule, 30’s would pay no tax whatsoever. Far right movements have sympathy amongst the young in various other countries, particularly Scandinavia and Germany, as a vehicle of protest by younger voters.\n",
      "Far right people across the continent having nothing in common with each other. Some hate ‘Western values’, some are ‘defending’ them. Some are young, some are old. Some politicians claim to be economically centre left, others are unashamedly capitalist. All hate Muslims, many have more in common Salafists than they do with white liberals. All spew hate.\n",
      "Stop legitimising their bigotry.\n",

      "This present incarnation of right wing Neo-nationalism is to do with money and turf. It is such a low common denominator politically that the most rudimentary manifestations of social institutions also have the same hierarchy of concerns; street gangs and mafias.\n",
      "This is all set up to protect wealth and territory. Once one does it they force all to respond. It is a vicious circle. The last time it happened millions of people had to die to break the curse. I am starting to see thousands die now. I hope it does not descend into a similar madness as before and millions start dying. That is what will happen in the end if it is allowed to concentrate into such a nasty pesto.\n",
      "I wish the left had not got itself into its own war that it can't win; culture wars. It has diminished and impoverished the left at a time when it needed to be a strong political challenger. Anything left only has a chance of gaining ground if anything right becomes so obviously aggressive to the needs and lives of the majority that it is worse than their pet political prejudices that keep them in a deluded propaganda based fear and control by their populist facilitators.\n",
      "It's going no place special. It may end up being something very nasty.

      "In the West, globalization has lowered prices of many if not most things but the gains and losses were very unevenly distributed across society: a slight layer who owned most of the shares of companies gained massivelly with much lower production costs from outsourcing while selling prices (hence revenue) were still at western levels creating vast profits in the middle, whilst a much larger group suffered from their jobs being outsourced and the resulting change against workers in supply/demand of work which slowly pushed lower the share of salaries in the total wealth being created and distributed (for example in the US salaries took 23% of revenues of companies back in the late 70s but only 7% by 2012).\n",
      "For a while this was compensated with increased indebtness: those who were not the owners of vast amounts of assets and whose income was mainly from their work couldn't afford anymore the same things as before, so they used debt to make up for it and total debt in the Economy increased with the eventual natural result as it became too much being the 2008 Crash (it's not by chance that ultra-low interest rates were the \"solution\" for it - as they lower the total interest, which is a slice of the new wealth society creates, that must be payed - and in over a decade it has not been possible to undo that supposedly temporary situation of ultra-low taxes) \n",
      "The stage we've been in since then is one were the slice of the population which captured most of the wealth has used their money to buy politics so as to maintain their rate of wealth capture even though the overall rate of wealth production fell precipituosly from earlier as there was little room for the masses to keep getting indebted to maintain the machinery going: the rich want to keep on growing their wealth in the same way but the overall Economy isn't growing like before as there are no more outsourcing gains and no more room for growth via indebtness, so they can only do it from pillaging from the rest and they used a slice of their wealth to capture the political and even judicial mechanisms which are supposedly representing the interests of and protecting the many.\n",
      "What we see at this point is a snapshot of this end state: the many are hurting, the few are getting wealthy mostly from pillaging, the \"center\" \"moderate\" politics has, after many years of their members being recipients of money from the richer classes transformed away from ideology and is populated by people who went into politics for personal enrichement, whilst a slice of politics who blame foreigners for the pain the many feel from the pillaging of locals has been subsidized (remember how Steve Bannon came to Europe with money from the Koch Fundation overtly to \"create far right parties\") as they are directing outwards the righteous anger for both the results of actions which are very much of internal actors and the seeming unwillingness of the elected representatives of people (most being the above mentionen idology free captured \"center\" of politics) of doing anything about it.\n",

Logically it is a poor argument, but it carries weight with many people. As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for Socialism is its adherents. \n",
      "The first thing that must strike any outside observer is thatSocialism, in its developed form is a theory confined entirely to themiddle classes. The typical Socialist is not, as tremulous old ladiesimagine, a ferocious-looking working man with greasy overalls and a raucousvoice. He is either a youthful snob-Bolshevik who in five years' time willquite probably have made a wealthy marriage and been converted to RomanCatholicism; or, still more typically, a prim little man with a white-collar job, usually a secret teetotaller and often with vegetarianleanings, with a history of Nonconformity behind him, and, above all, witha social position which he has no intention of forfeiting. This last typeis surprisingly common in Socialist parties of every shade; it has perhapsbeen taken over en bloc from. the old Liberal Party. In addition to thisthere is the horrible--the really disquieting--prevalence of crankswherever Socialists are gathered together. One sometimes gets theimpression that the mere words 'Socialism' and 'Communism' draw towardsthem with magnetic force every fruit-juice drinker, nudist, sandal-wearer,sex-maniac, Quaker, 'Nature Cure' quack, pacifist, and feminist in England.\n",

So, Centrists have real difficulty seeing that deregulation lead to the crash, which means they're fairly blind to point 1. Then, because they tend to think austerity works, they find the second step unavoidable - even though they don't approve of its direct consequences, namely the impact on the poor.\n",
      "Then, when political extremism hits, they tend to swing right, because that's where the new political centre is, rather than swinging left to counter it. This has the effect of reinforcing a right-wing shift.\n",
      "Nationalism is a consequence of austerity, because people who are badly affected by austerity tend to want to look after their own, personal interests, also because they have less time to look at wider issues. They're fearful and defensive, which correlates well with Nationalism.\n",
      "We are already seeing the destabilisation of Europe- as exemplified by this article. Unfortunately, centrist parties want to chase the same groups of people who are doing the destabilisation. For example, to put it bluntly, Labour hates Remainers and wants nothing to do with them; while embracing Brexit and Brexiters in the hope that these groups will vote for that kind of insincerity. They won't, all it does is further destabilise the country.\n",
      "And now, here we are, at the beginning of a war which Zelenskiy is clear, is an attack on the European project (as is Brexit). To get back on track - as we will inevitably have to do - means we have to reverse Brexit along with all these other things, because the longer we leave it, the heavier the cost as we are already seeing: each year is worse than the last.\n",

      "Zelinskiy is entirely right and has again restated something that has been obvious since well before Brexit, but which many politicians seem unable to fully grasp the implications of, that one of Putin's main aim is to destabilise and destroy the European project, and, insofar as he can, replace it with his own miserable model of autocratic, illiberal client states that he wishes to surround the Soviet Union with (and has in many instances already succeeded in achieving). Amongst this group he can now count Victor Orban's Hungary and he would love to add Le Pen's France to the list. The deep tentacles of Russian money and corruption in the UK means that we are already in many respects a client state, despite Johnson's windy blatherings to the contrary (and despite so many Russian linked 'donations' to the Tory party - the question must be, why?). Dependence on Russian gas / oil / coal has turned many other European states into clients, whether they want to be or not. Brexit was a huge success for Putin, now we see Johnson desperate to hoik himself centre state in the slipstream of the European Union, making ever more noisy pronouncements about his support for Ukraine (whilst making no noise at all about the UK's hopelessly, and deliberately, compromised response to the refugee crisis). Zelinsky absolutely sees that the fundamental principles of democracy are under threat, but that threat already existed in countries many kilometres distant from the zone of conflict, and few want to talk about this in government here, even as highly illiberal and undemocratic measures are cheerfully waived through the British Parliament. Putin's work is being done for him, and that is how he intends to 'win'. The submission of Europe is the bigger prize. He doesn't even need to invade the rest of Europe to achieve it.\n",

      "What’s going on? One factor is the impact of globalisation on advanced economies’ economic and social structures, captured by the famous “elephant curve” depicting how globalisation has influenced global income distribution over the decades. The curve in the middle is the relative improvement of incomes in many medium-income countries, particularly of their middle class, who have been helped as their countries catch up with richer neighbours. The elephant’s long, drooping tail is the continuing disadvantage faced by the world’s poor, the downward sloping of the trunk is what has happened to the incomes of the mass of workers in industrialised countries, while the last triumphant upward curve of the U-shaped trunk describes the ever lusher incomes of the elite – globalisation’s unchallenged beneficiaries. When ordinary French voters, at the wrong end of this global phenomenon, accuse Macron of being the president of the rich, this is what they mean.\n",

      "And they'd be right. Globalisation has been a disaster for the ordinary working people of industrialised, developed economies.

Little comfort when you've just been landed in it yourself. \n",

      "Too late Will. The liberal globalists have espoused identity politics which has alienated their traditional working class support , look at the collapse of the Red Wall , the rise of Le Pen , etc etc. It has also failed to defeat the Davos Consensus as it has been called , offshoring , de-industrialisation , free movement of capital , goods and mass economic migration , low taxes on corporations and the ultra wealthy and consequent real wage stagnation in the west. In representative democracies those affected have chosen to move toward social conservatism and anti globalism . You hint at this in your article but you fail to join the dots , the real consequence is that for the many the choice seems to be Melanchon or Le Pen , Corbyn or Johnson , or you just accept more of the same ..Macron , Cameron , Blair . In the end I suspect that whilst Macron may still shade this election the way is becoming clear for Le Pen’s niece Marion Marechal , next time I think is the probable first female President of the French Republic. But obviously we may yet be surprised , it will depend on how many of Melanchon’s voters abstain and how many of Pecresse’s voters vote Le Pen. What is also striking is how Le Pen now out scores Macron with younger voters . Finally , I think this has far more to do with a politics of relative economic advantage and very little to do with the EU , which is beginning to atrophy from within as you imply , this is a consequence of this late stage financialised global capitalism and the very large section of society which is embittered by it’s consequences. If your answer is just hold your nose and vote for Macron , well you might be right this time , just , but it’s not a winning strategy.\n",

But I think we have to mention how complacent many of us became with the fruits of LD over the decades. I have heard and seen these attitudes and ways of thinking in the various circles I have passed through over the years. This complacency manifested itself in comments and thinking as exemplified in 'can't be arsed voting', 'politicians are all the same', 'who cares' and yawns over the idea that we have to defend and argue vigorously for what we gained, gains which in general were the answers to the unspeakable horrors of state terror in the 1930s and 1940s.\n",

      "When the working class made things and things weren't as globalized or automated they could use unions and the witholding of their labour as a weapon to achieve concessions. That no longer works with globalisation, as production offshores to low regulation and low cost Labour. However, even globalisation is yesteryear's economic model. Robots and drones are posed to be even cheaper and are replacing sweatshop workers - even the famed outsourced call centres are now being replaced by automatic software and automation and 3d printing is allowing the click of a button to manufacture more and more things at home and cheaper than ever before.What Marxist theory never adequately addressed or anticipated is how people prefer to be exploited and needed than irrelevant.Automation, not communism or socialism, is capitalism's biggest threat. The shift in wealth is swinging away from making and creating toward owning, inheriting, renting and taking. In this sense capitalism is regressing back into feudalism.When machines make just about everything and wealth is derived from owning and taking (via owning of shares/property/drones/robots/automated factories) rather than producing, making and doing, the ‘just desserts’ basis for wealth justification breaks down. People's mentality towards money starts changing too. Money isn't a mulch to make things grow but a dragon hoard to clutch and keep. Wealth becomes poisonous, not productive\n",

Sometimes you can be right at the wrong time. Hold fire with advancing a progressive identitarian agenda until economic security is sorted. Once someone has dignified work in which they find meaning and identity and prosperity they are less likely to feel threatened by other identities or feel the need to take on national, racial and extreme sexist or religious identities.When an unemployed white working class man is told about positive discrimination and white privilege he thinks - 'that's someone who may be given a job advantage at my expense' and I'm being told to shut up about it.When told about a 0 emission green target, he translates that to think - who is manufacturing the wind turbines. Will that make energy more expensive - that's putting the country a competitive disadvantage with another country who will do the dirty job for cheaper and so there go more jobsThe right's austerity coupled with the left's identity politics = a culture war the left can't win because when people feel that resources are low then they feel threatened by the claims of others on what they think are limited resources and so the arguments grow.So sort out economic inequality first.

      "The division of contractualist vs organicist goes back to a dichotomy set out by the German philosopher Peter Sloterjik.A contractualist is another word for a Liberal and would see the relationship between an individual and society as involving lots of different individual willpoints, gifted with reason, coexisting when agreeing to cooperate to chase joint interests. Freedom here, is the ability to make choices to contract but the contracts must be guarded and enforced - e.g. by the state. An organicist would see relationships as coexisting like building blocks of a more total body, or hyperbody. Constitutive members finding a place, like stones in a facade. Freedom here is more instinctual and tribal or caste based and involves finding a role. Bonds are a collective kinship based on family, spiritual alliances, shared causes, shared values, participation of life in a polis.Contractualists are classic liberal capitalists with all the benefits (individual liberty) and downsides (transactional society)Organicists often prefer dictatorships and like religion / family / community / gender / caste roles.Contractualists prefer democracy as it involves making a pledge which contracts to fulfill a manifesto in exchange for power and protects private property.Organicists like communism or dictatorships or nationalism where you play a role as part of a whole\n",

      "For far too long, we’ve off-loaded our security commitments to the (formerly) lone superpower, the United States. Appeals to international law, which still has no sovereign able to enforce it, are often futile when the most powerful states in the world are determined to utilise force in order to get what they want; where was the condemnation and ostracism Putin and the Russian Government are — rightly — being subject to when it was the United States and Great Britain or otherwise NATO that used force to change the facts on the ground? The hypocrisy here is staggering and at the same time also principled and correct. It is also too late.\n",
      "Putin will get what he wants because he is, quite simply put, prepared to go further than we are and willing to cross any threshold he needs to in order to get what he wants. That is our tragedy; it is Ukraine’s; it is also the Russian people’s, in whose hands the only chance for peace now lie. Unfortunately, as much as sovereignty remains that one sacrosanct principle in international relations, that same sovereignty which serves as the condition of possibility for peace and prosperity domestically is also the source of so much insecurity and violence internationally. This is precisely why organisations such as the United Nations and the European Union — peace projects both, and also primarily political in orientation — have sought to promulgate a corpus of international law that constrains the absolute sovereignty of states beyond their own borders.\n",
      "Equally unfortunate, these constraints are also rather unequal in their effects because the age-old Thucydidean observation that ‘large states do what they will and small states accept what they must’ remains as true now as ever it has done: in such a world, sovereignty exists only insofar as that claim can be defended through force of arms, and the more powerful states in the international system will often act in ways contrary to the maintenance of peace and security in said system on those occasions where they deem it in their own vital interests to do so. That is as true now for Putin’s Russia vis-à-vis Ukraine as it was for the US and UK in 2003 versus Iraq and as it was for JFK in Cuba (likewise Afghanistan for the USSR or, dare I say it, potentially even Taiwan for **CHINA** and Xi). There was, and is, no justification in any of these cases yet that does not fundamentally alter the facts created on the ground when such states rely upon the use of force (authorised or not under international law) to pursue their interests.\n",
      "As ever, in the world of international politics, the only true thing from the fairy tales we tell ourselves are its monsters.\n",
      "Provided this conflict does not escalate into a far more calamitous conflagration, our best hope as Europeans — and that includes the UK regardless of Brexit — is that we all start to take President Macron’s defence proposals much more seriously, invest more in our own defence (ironically, the one thing about which Donald Trump was correct), and to seek the necessary synergies to maximise our collective defence potential. I am not a fan of the NATO alliance as military alliances in general have a historical tendency to lead to the very thing they are intended to prevent, as J. David Singer’s Correlates of War research project proves, but ultimately, without a Europeanised mini-NATO, and almost certainly whilst ever the Russian dictator remains in power, our security and strategic interests shall inevitably remain at the whim and mercy of powers greater than each of us individually.\n",
      "For now, the best that can be hoped for is that Ukraine survives this and the conflict itself is contained, because the worst-case scenario is quite simply too terrible for any of us to contemplate given Putin has already made a thinly veiled threat as to where that could lead us.\n",

Of the three groups mentioned only **CHINA** has a strong record of not invading other countries. NATO is meant to be a defence pact of democratic countries, however, we have seen that it does use force to try to change other countries to democracies.\n",

Hopefully we would not use it as an excuse to start a war, but there might be unease, suspicion and reaction.\n",
      "Right now we need to do all we can to stop the war and encourage the Russian forces back to Russia. Long term we need to be check whether we are so enthralled with democracy that we risk turning into modern day crusaders. It is unlikely that among humans there is one perfect society and whilst we might feel democracy is best for us we need to respect other kinds of communities and be part of a global non aggression pact.\n",

As long as that continues, so will the stimulus for the revolution against exploitation along with the defence of being able to exploit. Similarly, natural resources have long been the reason for fighting.\n",

America First which began with Obama, was ramped up by Trump and which continues with Biden has seen the fast declining super power in full blown retreat across the world leaving local vacuums for the likes of Tsar Putin to move into. America itself is on the cusp of its own civil war as the consequences of the 2008 bail out of the failed and anachronistic capitalist system finally work themselves out as a massive assault on poor and working class people that will make the austerity of 2010-20 seem benign. The war the West wants is not with Russia but with **CHINA** that it built up and now wants to knock down and it is hoping that by ceding Ukraine to Putin they can rely on his neutrality or even support for that bloody endeavour. As capitalist globalization unravels and collapses the world's imperialist elites are looking to re-divide the world on terms more favourable to themselves and find a new balance-of-power. But there is no new order of things that can give capitalism a new lease of life. The violence required to establish such a thing would in itself be sufficient to end human existence.\n",
