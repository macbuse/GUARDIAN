      "Yet a bit simplistic, perhaps for length, but I generally feel that the opinion piece is correct. Immunity is a rather funny business. Viral immunity is encumbered -to the extent that it can be summarized at least - by many peculiar aspects of its nature. First, there is a general divide between mucosal limit of viral action on a nasal, mouth, eye, lung, gut, skin, bladder or sexual organ lining as versus a deeper infection in the circulatory system. Surface infections of the former variety rarely cause long-term immunity. It is the generalized nature of the latter infections which maintain longer responses to the extent that they will. the antigen presenting cells of the former, including Langerhans cells and some macrophages may not present the foreign material as efficiently and the IgA antibodies, or at least the variety mostly produced may be delivered of B cells which are less long-responding. Perhaps this suppresses excess red eyes, sneezing and other problems as ongoing skin irritations; who is to know. Yet the difference is important because many viruses, including some Coronaviruses act only locally and create no long-standing response including OC43 and many cousins of Covid19. It is conceivable that the SARS-CoV-2 Virus might occasionally do so and return with no good defense prepared despite its past visit. Most who get the infection to circulating areas of the blood, lymphatics or at least the extracellular fluids of deep tissues mount improved later responses. Some -including President Trump - who have gotten steroids may be less capable of doing so as the immune response damping by medicine is non-selective and cannot limit its action to what we want to suppress when we use it. Others had impaired function beforehand.None of this changes the message above, but it does fine tune the whole to a major extent in the most important manner.With a disease that presents differently and often quite camouflaged, the utility of simple phrases and means of address in treatment is startlingly difficult. That problem is amplified in the extreme by the target, a species which is nearly infinite in its potential to act variably and often hideously poorly in the face of threats. These two situations make for a great deal of bother here.What will help a great deal of the people in many of the countries which have done well is the ability to surrender some individual response in submission to authority for the purposes of the common good. Countries such as Taiwan, Korea and Vietnam, not to forget China have done better -at least for a time -due to this. I am not saying that this will last, that it was a much better ideal behavior in general or that we can now adapt this in the U.S, the UK or other areas. Being more submissive has been at least temporarily useful in those countries however and do make things a bit easier for a time. Where people refuse to act in the common good or challenge the current beliefs some clear good can come, but probably less readily during a Pandemic. What I have said here is still not quite as accurate as I would want it to be, but it reflects some yet what I would hope to be a more rough approximation of thing as they stand.\n",

      "Boris Johnson is probably at the end of his wits - which in his case is not a long journey for him to make - regarding the effects of Coronavirus on his person and on the people of the United Kingdom but the Prime Minister is not the sole political leader of the world to be confronted with the dilemma which the illness has caused\n",
      "It may be the case that there is only a single viable solution to the problem - confinement at home for every person on the planet until the plague has ravaged its last victim and ensuring that however many of the 8,000,000,000 members of our family remain extant thereafter are tested to prevent any recurrence of the condition\n",
      "It would mean that governments subsidised the lives of everyone in the world and when the Coronavirus was defeated then discussions could be held about defraying the costs but the current balancing act between health and economy is going to cause sporadic eruptions of the illness over the course of years\n",
      "It is possible that another solution exists which may enable life to resume in some form but it depends upon attention being given to a range of variable factors\n",
      "It has been a personal belief for several months that the government of Britain should not have been concerned with peripheral matters such as washing hands, wearing face masks or maintaining a distance between people when this was not possible to do but ought to have issued the entire population with 'Hazardous Material' suits\n",
      "It could not have been difficult to divert from the production of masks or ventilators to manufacture instead the type of carbon fibre or plastic or even kevlar defensive armour required to ensure that we would not be able to contract or transmit the infection or indeed contaminate a crime scene\n",
      "It would have been necessary to produce the clothing in a variety of colours and sizes to distinguish the Armed Forces and the Emergency Services and medical and clinical staffs who do routinely make use of the suits and separate them from civilians but it could not have been difficult to have our names emblazoned on the backs of the tunics and it may have enabled life to continue with a simulacrum of normality\n",
      "It could have been possible to avoid 'social distancing' and allowed Shops, Cinemas, Theatres and Libraries to remain open to the public and Restaurants and Pubs to operate to a limited extent and the multifarious nature of the uniforms should have allowed us to differentiate between Harlequins and Leicester or Northampton on the field and the Association Football season would have been played to a conclusion with spectators in the Stadia and parading the latest trends in Hazardous Materials styling is bound to have transformed London Fashion Week but there may have been objections to Sir Kenneth Branagh wearing an All-Black costume to play the title role of Othello at Stratford-Upon-Avon\n",
      "It could have been a fad or a farce or a tragedy but a scheme that compelled the wearing of Hazardous Materials suits in public in the United Kingdom would have cost c. £3,000,000,000 set against the current losses of revenue to the Exchequer and been far less dangerous than ingesting bleach or disinfectant as alternative proposals\n",

But all our politicians across the board, the DfE and universities have over estimated their abilities to create bubbles to protect the students, teachers, staff and the local population, and by doing that have triggered the resurgence of transmission. \n",
      "The clusters of new infections are geographically located around universities, making the residents of those cities and towns quite resentful towards the young who are perceived as the cause of new restrictions. Furthermore, the paucity of data in relation to the impact of programs like the \"eat out to help out\", the millions travelling abroad for holidays, and pubs opening, has created a vacuum which is filled by crooks and rogue actors who further confuse the people and even undermine the public health messages.\n",

      "Could it be that the way that Vietnam, New Zealand and China's apparent success in managing this public health crisis is not just down to strategy and committed policy makers, the state's ability to enforce rules and laws, but has a lot to do with behaviour and social attitudes, perhaps inspired by Confucian values and ethics?\n",
      "Singapore and South Korea were also given as successful in managing this pandemic, yet their success turned out to be short lived.\n",
      "The countries who seem to be on top of controlling the chains of transmission have introduced strict rules in relation to international and domestic travel; have functional test, trace, isolate and surveillance systems, with policy makers focus on delivering rather than on campaigning, photo shots and media appearances.\n",
      "Our airlines moan about the drop in the number of travellers, yet the data is not as clearcut, as EasyJet's stats show. The HO lead by a ministers who has pledged \"take back control\", seems surprisingly willing to open our doors to hundreds of thousands of people coming from countries where this pandemics is totally out of control, let alone it has no resources to check wether people follow the quarantine rules or not, which again are not as clear cut as pundits are claiming to be.\n",
      "This virus loves social interaction, therefore breaking the chains of transmission requires some relatively easy measures: strict controls over domestic and international travel, proper personal hygiene, social distancing, wearing face masks, daily cleaned and properly ventilated means of public transportation homes and offices/ factories/ schools and other public buildings, wide public awareness over dos and don'ts and a collective willingness to be follow the rules rather than circumvent them.\n",
      "Telling people it's OK to travel, offering them perverse subsidies to \"eat out to help out\", presuming that it's will be OK to have around 2.5 million domestic and international students travelling up and down the country, with millions more of secondary school pupils travelling by train or other means of public transportation to go to school, granting various types of visas to hundreds of thousands of migrants from countries with very high infection rates might provide some respite to the markets and reassure investors, but the costs will be multiplied and al point at incompetent policy makers \"nudged\" by corporate lobbyists.\n",
      "We are a long way from regaining any resemblance of normality. One way to control the spreading of conflicting information will be to press pause on social media networks and close the doors to lobbyists.\n",

      "Well, let's look at the more complete record from various SAGE meeting minutes chronologically;\n",
      "\"Wearing a face mask by people with COVID-19 symptoms is recommended, \"if tolerated.\" But the wearing of face masks by well-people living with symptomatic people is not recommended, because it won't make any difference to whether they get infected. Wearing face masks by well-people interacting with well member of the public (either occupationally or otherwise) is not recommended...\"\n",
      "\"(Members noted that) the evidence for [mask] use is very weak and limited for those with prolonged contact with symptomatic individuals in the same household. The evidence for [mask] use in the general public is near nil.\"\n",
      "\"Nervtag advises that there is limited to no evidence of the benefits of the general public wearing face masks as a preventative measure. Face masks and other personal protective equipment in the community is only advised for health and social care workers visiting individuals who may be infectious.\"\n",
      "(SAGE) Members raised concerns around explaining why face masks were acceptable for healthcare staff but not the general public. \n",
      "From teh minutes: \"The difference is that healthcare staff are trained to use the masks and know when to change the masks when they become soggy or contaminated however with the general public, there is no control over how they would use the surgical face masks so they may use the same one for a week which is inappropriate.\" \n",
      "\"NERVTAG concluded that the increased use of masks would have minimal effect in stopping people becoming infected.\"\n",
      "(SAGE notes that) \"the World Health Organization has said there is currently no conclusive evidence that face masks are beneficial for community use.\"\n",
      "\"Evidence does not currently support use of face masks to protect the wearer in the general population, although if someone is infectious it will reduce transmission. It says the evidence is marginally in favour of a small effect but only in specific circumstances - in enclosed environments.\"\n",
      "Then, we have a paper from a behavioural group on behavioural considerations of telling everyone to wear face masks: It begins with the warning \"we are unaware of evidence relating to these hypotheses.\" Then, \"if they (face masks) are recommended the message should be that they are in addition to social distancing and should be a sign that the wearer is trying to protect other people, rather than themselves.\" It then goes on to discuss some risks... \"People wearing them badly, reusing them and not disposing of them properly; use of \"ineffective homemade masks...\"\n",
      "Back to Nervtag/SAGE, \"No evidence to support long term mass wearing of face coverings or wearing them outdoors.\"\n",
      "In May, Johnson suggests \"face coverings\" as a means of \"easing lockdown\".\n",

      "The problem with the rest of the world is that we hedged, hesitated, dithered, entertained selfish people who whined about wearing a mask as if it were akin to a Medieval torture device, and refused to socially distance. \n",
      "So you are truly comparing apples and oranges. Yes. Most Asian countries and places like New Zealand have the luxury of going without lockdowns precisely because they did lockdowns. The hopscotch approach the rest of the world has adopted is an abject failure. We know this because of the numbers. It also remains to be seen what happens in the next weeks. The images of hundreds of thousands swamping the Great Wall of China, may soon come back to haunt them.\n",
      "So if we want the freedoms others now experience, we have some hard work to do. The good news is that we know hard lockdowns work. The bad news is that the West has been singularly reluctant to do anything that makes sense. Last night, CNN broke a story late that will get lost in the usual noise, but the CDC is now (finally!!) admitting that schools are vectors for spreading the disease. On the one hand...duh. duh. duh. On the other...finally truth and logic are being spoken. \n",
      "What? It wasn't enough to have actual numbers, data, charts showing clear-cut spikes two weeks after the world opened its schools, tales from families who lost students and teachers and coaches, doctors warning that it made no sense? So precisely what I predicted in May has happened. The world went back to school and reignited this virus. You cannot moan about a bar being opening (total time of exposure an hour or two) and then gleefully go about parking people in large numbers in closed building with poor access to water (the new bathroom in my school has no hot water!!?) and not expect there to be outbreaks.\n",
      " Remote learning saves lives; it is the only safe option right now.\n",
      "This pandemic will drag on for years unless we pony up and go to remote learning for a year, allow time for vaccines to be tested, and work on better protocols. But sure...let's just blindly flail ahead, toss our children (!) into self-evidently harmful environments, overwhelm our healthcare workers who are on the brink of collapse already, deplete PPE sources that don't exist, and then sit around and marvel at how and why this is happening. \n",

      "I think that there are three areas where the UK government really got it wrong.\n",
      "The first is that they do not understand the time lag between infections and statistics. If I get infected today, it may take several days until I show symptoms. It may then take a few days until I get tested, a few more days until the result is known, and then a few days until my infection is included in the stats. By the time the government knows there is a spike in infections somewhere it could be two weeks since these infections occurred. If they then take a week to see how the spike develops, the spike may have already spiralled out of control. The opposite is also true: when measure start to take effect, we may not know it for several weeks and cause much economic damage by unnecessary restrictions.\n",
      "The second problem is the communication with local authorities. Local governments know the situation ‘on the ground’ much better than a fee folks in Westminster, so why not work with them, share the science with them, and come to a good approach together. The corona-virus is not political in nature, and even Labour mayors like Zadiq Khan and Andy Burnham try to do the best for their communities. Why not work with them.\n",
      "And the third problem is the messaging from the government to the people. Where leaders like Jacinta Ardern, but also Nicola Sturgeon have been great is that they have taken the people with them and have been consistent in their message. But the Johnson government has gone through so many u-turns and local variations, that no one (including the PM himself) knows anymore what rules apply to them. And even if they do, they have bad examples like Dominic Cummings, Robert Jenrick en even the PM’s father making clear that it is one rule for them and another for everyone else. The difference between Cummings and Margaret Ferrier is that, whilst both broke the rules, the SNP has expelled Ferrier from the party whereas Cummings is still sitting in nr 10.\n",
      "Covid-19 is new to everyone, and we all have to learn as we go along. The problem with the UK government is not that they got some things wrong, but that they do not have the kind of leader who can take the people with them.\n",

We can't have any clear idea of how many deaths actually resulted. \n",
      "With that said, I am glad to have her highlight again the unlikely prospects for \"herd immunity\". We don't have herd immunity to the common cold (not controlled at all) or influenza (we have to rely on creating annual or seasonal vaccines based on guesswork as to prevailing strains and this may be sufficient to create effective immunity - unless the drug companies guess wrong), or, as she points out, to any number of serious diseases which have existed for many centuries. \n",
      "We already know that coronavirus infection does not confer lasting or permanent immunity to reinfection, as well as that the virus can have profound and serious long-term health effects for those who survive. \n",
      "The herd immunity argument appears to be deployed by people who find measures to control the virus economically or politically undesirable, or who are friendly to the governments (notably in the UK and the USA) which have mismanaged the pandemic particularly badly, in order to excuse the excess deaths and economic disruption which would be caused by abandoning these measures. \n",
      "They also appear to have \"fellow travellers\" in well-meaning persons distressed by the knock-on effects of more stringent control measures. The effect on the treatment of other serious diseases is an obvious one.As she points out, however, the problem is that we have no indication that herd immunity could even be a viable and effective strategy, even if we accepted the substantial number of \"excess deaths\" which would result in the short term. We do have positive indications, on the other hand, that reinfection with the virus is possible in at least some and possibly all cases. It simply is not a viable or sensible strategy to pursue at this time. We will need much more epidemiological data and a viable vaccine (as with flu) to think about attempting this.\n",

      "An excellent article and spot on as to what is needed. Unfortunately for us, the elephant in the room here is the reality that not only have we not done the needed things, we cannot do them. The very reasons that prevent us from instituting an effective track, trace, isolate regime are the same reasons that we were so woefully unprepared for the outbreak in the first place, so slow to react compared to others and now cannot manage the pandemic with any tools other than the most cruel and crude (lockdown).\n",
      "The last 30 years of \"there is no such thing as society\" ethos, proprietarian social and economic actions, increasing inequality, increasing monetisation, privatisation and dis-investment of public services, and loss of the interest in the common good make us totally unprepared for what is happening now. The phrase \"viral outbreaks happen naturally and all the time, it takes human failure to make a pandemic\" rings true. Not only that, the current ethos limits the vision and scope of response from govenment, whose answers are to preserve the system, help the wealthy, jobs more than people, increasingly authoritarian responses and taking opportunities for further monetisation and privatisation.\n",
      "Yes, the nations that have done well mostly have more authoritarian politics than we do. But many of them have, despite that, very well developed systems of social and citizen support, not just safety nets. And the sense of community may be somewhat imposed, but for most of them, it works and is acceptable to the population. And places like NZ and Germany, who do not have particularly authoritarian regimes, are also exemplars. So there is no way to say we can't or couldn't have done the same while maintaining a nominally democratic society. (I say nominally because the UK version of democracy is not terribly democratic). But we certainly cannot respond effectively now unless we reverse the ethos and actions that have weakened our ability to care for and regard each other and which have been so consciously imposed over the past decades. That's a big elephant and well-established.\n",

She is a beacon of pure sunlight in the inky darkness cast over the country by months of Johnson-Cummings inept blustering, with no clear plan as we head into winter.\n",

      "Prof Sridhar has said if such a change was made things could start to improve, in terms of testing and tracing, within a couple of weeks.

      "The overwhelming majority of Covid-19 deaths are old and/or already very ill. Of course there are other factors like obesity, which were evident from very early on, in the same way that the obese suffer other serious medical conditions: obesity accounts for between 80% - 85% of the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Around 17,000 die each year in the UK from seasonal flu - I am not saying that Covid-19 is the same as flu, of course it isn't - that figure is reduced to 8,000 when those who would most likely have died within twelve months anyway are subtracted by the DoH. If the same statistical criterion were applied to Covid-19 deaths what would you estimate the current mortality rate to be when reduced?\n",
      "My position is that I believe that consensus is better than coercion; that the Coronavirus Act 2020 should be repealed and that any proposed future measures should be voted on by MPs; that lockdowns kill people - some experts estimate as many as 75,000 deaths - as well as killing the national and local economies and are epidemiologically pointless; that we should voluntarily wear masks when inside any public space; that we should observe social distancing on a voluntary basis; that we should wash our hands regularly and avoid touching our faces between washes; that the 'vulnerable' have the right to make their own choices based on their own levels of accepted risk; that those who are not at risk of dying - the vast majority - should not be stopped from contracting the virus; that the volume of those contracting need to be controlled only if the NHS might be overwhelmed; that testing should be localised and that we are clear on its purpose, which seems not be the case at present given the chaos in the way the data is analysed.

We had no feeling of deprivation, although I admit that getting North Sea gas put in to replace our coal fire was a big event as we could light a little burner and have hot water whenever we wanted it not just when the fire was lit (when the fire was not lit we boiled pans on the stove which ran off town gas).

This is a very nasty, highly contagious, highly dangerous pathogen which unfortunately may be politically inconvenient for this Johnson government’s grand political plans but it is not going away anytime soon even if an effective vaccine is developed and rolled out in 2021/2022. Psychologically this Johnson government have still not come to terms with the new Covid 19 reality that has completely changed the global economic and political landscape forever. They can be no going back to the world of 2019. This is why this Johnson government continue to ignore the new reality and continue to distract themselves by continuing to obsess about their petty little political projects including Brexit which due to the changes already brought about by Covid 19 to the global economy and political landscape are simply no longer important or even relevant. The world has now moved on but this Johnson government still refuses point blank to accept this changed reality and this is the reason why everything they now touch quickly morphs into a complete catastrophe. They have simply lost their grip on reality and believe that purely by the collective exercise of their low grade political wills together with self deluded political propaganda and simple slogans that they can reshape the entire European continent and planet - Nurse ! Seriously heavy medication now for Mr Johnson and his friends !\n",

      "I certainly would give credit to Jacinda Ardern and her Government for acting quickly and decisively but they were massively aided by the geography of New Zealand; that it’s made up of islands without land borders, has a small population and low population density and that relatively speaking it’s on the periphery of international travel and started from a pre-pandemic position where it didn’t have anything like the number of people travelling in and out as European countries, let alone the US, have.\n",
      "So you cannot directly compare NZ to Europe, the UK or US.\n",
      "It’s also the case that the strategy is reliant on maintaining the 100% integrity of the quarantine ‘seal’ on people (and therefore the virus) coming into NZ. That will have to be maintained indefinitely until such time as a vaccine can be found and/or the pandemic globally comes to an end. \n",
      "Forgive me if I’m wrong but in most of the South East Asian countries at least one of the below applies;- they have seen far more cases than New Zealand, or - they are islands, and/or- the point about being on the periphery of international travel and starting from a position of relatively few people travelling in and out applies, and/or- they have imposed draconian or intrusive controls on their populations that wouldn’t be acceptable in a western democracy.\n",
      "For the UK this approach could only be contemplated if Ireland was fully signed up to following the same policy (which would mean the Republic of Ireland indefinitely suspending free movement from the EU), because otherwise you run into all the familiar and vexed issues around the Irish border. Then there is the question of our reliance on road haulage of goods from the EU, which requires drivers (and therefore potentially the virus) to cross the quarantine border in and out of the country from continental Europe.\n",
      "So there are good reasons why no British Government would have followed the New Zealand approach.\n"

      "Revised: It depends what you mean by lockdown. It’s a curious term in that it no longer simply denotes the regime of not allowing anyone out bar an hour a day, having evolved into a metonym for distancing restrictions generally. The lockdowns these northern regions are under are only lockdowns in the metonymic sense of more extreme enforcements of the regulations we are all under. No one really knows whether we are in or out of lockdown any longer. Lockdown just is the permanent condition we live under in this endless war against a virus that, perhaps, can never be beaten - like the war on terror.\n",
      "From this perspective, lockdown versus trace and test is a false binary. Trace and test is another form of lockdown. For to work - or give the appearance of working - it would require the entire population to be put under semi-permanent surveillance and all who become infected along with all their associates compulsorily confined to their homes. Is that viable? \n",
      "God knows what is going on in these countries you find so laudable. But to start with China, its an authoritarian regime with a lamentable human rights record, so all its claims should be regarded with a degree of circumspection. Taiwan, Vietnam and South Korea are to a lesser degree relying on their battle against the virus on surveillance technologies that raise serious civil liberties concerns. And NZ has seemingly got on top of the virus, but at the expense of closing it’s borders. \n",

      "Okay, 80% of people (or more) do not display official symptoms. So in order to give trace and test even the semblance of working, all of us would have to be continually monitored for infection and then made to stay regardless of whether we chose to. Moreover, borders would have to be very tightly policed. That is an authoritarian form of governance. \n",
      "Then there is the problem of certain demographics of people becoming identified as disease vectors. At the moment in New York’s borough of Brooklyn there is a big problem with the orthodox Jewish community refusing to abide by the restrictions and gathering in large groups to attend religious ceremonies while living in large inter-generational households comprising closely-knit communities. These communities are being identified by data as transmission hotspots, and understandably these people are not happy at being singled out. \n",
