Given this is the case, the BMI measure itself is not really the issue.

There is also a lack of 'joining the dots' in terms of the eventual cost of physical ill health caused by the different types of eating disorder. \n",

I first started noticing I was gaining weight in my late 20's and I could not seem to help it. I was previously 'normal' build, fit and healthy. I did however have a very stressy job. This got in the way of exercise. It also led me to use alcohol as a stress reliever. I now realise the stress was affecting my mental health, which in turn affected my intake, and then my physical health. Over a period of more than 20 years my BMI went from 'normal' to 48. The worst advice I ever got from my GP was 'there were no fat people in Belson'. True, but not very helpful really. It was only after I turned 50 that I started getting other health related issues, and it was becoming a problem. The NHS offered nothing for my 'eating disorder' which was self evident. I was however offered knee surgery, blood pressure tablets and statins and much more for things brought on by my unhealthy intake! \n",
      "Fortunately for me, I had an epiphany. I realised my stressy job was shaping my mind so that I was eating badly, drinking badly, had no time to exercise and it was a very bad combo. I realised that if I did not take control of this, I would die young. So I quit my job, quit drinking, quit smoking, and took my dietary intake ultra seriously. I lost all the weight I needed to, and not only got my body mass back to where it should be. I am 1000% more healthy. I am now a health food addict. I have a fitness watch, a fitness regime, and do all the exercise my body needs. This makes my mind better. I have never been happier. My GP told me I am the most self-improved patient he has ever seen. I did not say back to him 'no thanks to you mate'! \n",
      "I realise not everyone has the luxury of chucking in their stressy job or taking on these changes themselves. What I find depressing is that with hindsight, the changes I needed to make should have been obvious, but far from not getting any specialist help, I didn't even get any rudimentary help. I got nothing. I did it myself. This is not so good for the many that can't, be they obese, or anorexic or anything else. Mental health, dietary intake and physical health are all inextricably linked, and it is about time resources were allocated to people struggling with this, rather than just dealing with the consequences. I now take a fraction of the medications I did, because I am much healthier. This should be obvious, but as I said earlier, nobody appears to be joining the dots.\n",

      "I have BED (Binge Eating Disorder) and it has made me morbidly obese. This is the most common eating disorder in this country but it is the least talked about. Whenever eating disorders are mentioned it is always Anorexia or Bulemia that gets the spotlight. My eating disorder with eventually kill me if I can't get it under control, just the same as anorexia kills. Yet people have zero knowledge or sympathy about it. To a lot of people, I am just fat, lazy, greedy, and stupid. I suspect there are many obese people who are wondering why they can't diet. Why they always sabotage themselves, why it gets harder and harder to get back to eating healthily after a \"cheat\" day. And cheat day becomes two days, then three, then a week. They wondering why they panic if they start to lose weight even though they are also happy about it. Why they hurry to put the weight back on and then some. Why every meal is a battle, the despair, the anxiety, the self-loathing. Being \"good\" in front of people, then eating in secret where no one can see. Slowly withdrawing from social contact. Only going somewhere if there is food involved. Being anxious at buffets, seeing food wasted, other people taking it all, unable to gauge what is a lot or normal portion. Being utterly bloody sick of thinking about food. Being utterly bloody sick of explaining it to people, including medical professionals who should know better. Being utterly bloody sick of public policy ignoring it. Being utterly bloody sick of that person (and there will be a few on here) explaining how to diet/be thin/exercise/eat healthy/live your life \"that's what I do, it's simple innit\".

      "BMI can neither adequately address Obesity nor even its opposite of malnutrition terribly well. The ability of mass/weight to clearly define a state of health is compromised by the nature of the weight's contributing factors.Kwashiorkor malnutrition causes water accumulation from protein deficiency (albumin, prealbumin) which can mask tissue loss, mostly in children though sometimes in adults. Arm circumference may be a better index for malnutrition.Obesity has the issue of muscle mass. Muscle, being dense by comparison, is quite small in volume compared to its heft. This results in a muscular man or woman having the same weight as a rather chunky overweight individual with much more bulky fat deposits of lesser density.BMI has been quick to measure. It is reproducable as well. That is the extent of its benefit however.Fat could be measured by calipers at the lateral chest, mid triceps (upper arm) and lateral thigh, but this requires training, tables for age and gender and is quite complicated to learn. Special scales can measure what they claim to be fat deposits. Caution is required due to assumptions, not the least of which is their safety.  Caution: such scales are not for those with Cardiac defibrillators or nerve or spinal stimulator devices! Unwanted discharges can occur or possible alteration of the parameters of a nerve stimulator system. Such scale devices are generally labelled, but I have encountered physician office staffs which are not knowledgeable to the extent of the contraindication. Ready answers of ease are not clear to me.\n",

      "People over size 12 are considered obese, clothes are made to fit a teenage girl, not a woman with curves. Money is often an issue for many people so the parent/s will ensure their children eat first and then eat what's left over. If anything. There is less physical exercise and more sedentary work than ever, and you don't burn many calories sitting down, so even people with an average appetite will find themselves putting on weight if they don't move that much in the course of a day. My dad never used to eat lunch when he was at work. Instead he worked through his lunch break. I'm going the same way working from home, although it has to be said that I could do with adjusting my attitude to food to include more healthy options and less junk food.\n",

      "It's difficult to actually detect until becomes obvious though, right? A lot of people have disordered eating, skipping meals, fasting, needing to exercise after eating etc...but when does this disorder become an actual problem that requires intervention? My daughter suffered from anorexia a few years ago when she was 13. We should have seen it coming, she worried about being fat, what she ate, did loads of sport...but when is that normal, and when is it a problem. In the end it became obvious because she pretty much stopped eating and started losing weight rapidly.The help we got was one of those family therapy plans, where she stays home, but we are given a feeding plan, and she is basically told to follow it otherwise she'd end up in hospital and they would feed her. It was hard bloody work, but she got there, and as her weight gains her mental health improves, but it doesn't just go away...it is there always. She never got any actual therapy, it was always about getting her to a healthy weight, and then she was discharged.During lockdown we have had a few worrying moments, but on the whole she's been ok, she doesn't want to go back there.It's a horrible illness. And it spirals out of control. I would suggest anyone who is worried about themselves or someone else, get help early...because it can be devastating.\n",

This could be why there is a shortage of consultants as it can be a bleak and despairing condition to work with, often feeling as if for every step forward made two are taken backward upon discharge.

One consequence of starving oneself all day to then - possibly - eat at the end of the day, is to actually gain weight - AND can contribute to the onset of diabetes. And an inability to lose any weight at all - and it becomes a horrible vicious cycle.I suffer with disordered eating - orthorexia if you will. I cannot remember the last time I ate something nutritious - and only recently stopped taking various supplements, when advised that they require food intake to metabolise properly.I am on my GP records as overweight - but that is because I never went to them when I went down to six and half stone - so it was never noted - or noticed. In the end, my system rebounded and I cannot eat anything at all without some kind of ill effect.In my horse-owning days, his diet was scientifically calculated and montiored for his well being and lifestyle, adjusted as necessary.

      "There's a wonderful book by Todd Rose called The End of Average. He argues successfully (imo) that much of today's life has been designed around the mythical “average person.” And such people simply do not exist. So it is with BMI, an index that can be significant at population level for certain kinds of statistical applications. That's it.It's bad enough that some insurance companies use BMI in determining life insurance risks. It's worse that the medical community uses it as a shortcut to determine 'average' health and potential treatment. As Ms Ayton points out, obesity and eating disorders are two sides of the same coin and the predominance of ultra-processed food in our diet is increasingly being seen as the major factor. In that context, there is much to be done but without more medical school places, we will employ yet more AI approaches to make judgements based on averages such as those established by BMI ratios. In summary, BMI is often incorrect - it's use can cause great harm.\n",

My view is that all the factors that play a part in your overall health (how do you even measure “health”?), like diet, exercise/movement, sleep, sun exposure, etc, are all decisions you have to make on a daily basis, and all are undermined by an incredible amount of contradictory information you encounter from medical professionals, scientists, tv doctors, celebrities, bloggers & (worst if all) influencers. Mental health is the battle to keep all of this in some sort of perspective with relation to reality. Literally fretting over the number of calories you consume, cholesterol levels, BMI, etc, are all contributors to mental health problems, but to take a pragmatic outlook, every functioning individual is responsible for their own life and health, and I’m afraid there seems to be a massive amount of ignorance and lack of personal responsibility driving these societal issues.\n",

Speaking as someone who has spent time on an inpatient eating disorder ward, the over-focus on BMI concerned me when it felt like the main sign of successful recovery. Reaching a healthy BMI doesn't mean that a sufferer is 'fixed' - it's just one part of a recovery process that involves a lot of internal rewiring and psychosocial work, never mind dealing with all kinds of anxieties and trauma. I worried a lot about fellow patients not getting the full treatment they needed while inpatients just because BMI was the main yardstick for recovery.

Enjoying food and drink is a pretty basic feature of family life but when you have to try to cater for a loved one that refuses to eat, join a table where people are eating, go shopping for food or even discuss food with them and they refuse it saps the enjoyment of living for all. It splits families. The support required to help a sufferer is exhausting for the primary carer, and as a secondary carer myself, I'm not allowed a voice, helping the split. And all the time you are seeing a loved one turn to skin and bone but unable to help them.

      "The biggest issue in countering anti-immigrant politicians is that it's the people least effected by or most reliant on **IMMIGRATION** who are the most taken in by the policies. Voting patterns show that voters in overcrowded cities and younger people who don't seem that taken in by the policies. It's mostly the regions especially places with declining populations that have voted for anti-immigrant politicians (obvs). Older voters, who rely on migrants for care, also seem particularly keen to send their carers home. And that's not just a dig at Brexiters, Lombardy, one of the oldest regions in Italy, voted to leave Italy in an informal referendum. \n",

      "No, we need borders (probably) to manage resources, but we need to put away our counters. Just as when you go (or went pre-covid) to the pub or cinema and assumed the people in charge were not going to let double the capacity in, we can assume that the bad asses running **IMMIGRATION** are not opening the floodgates.\n",

      "What Polly's article ignores is the implications of climate change in terms of migration. People from regions that will be badly affected by climate change will need to move to places that will not be so badly affected. Civilised human beings will see the need to make room for these migrants. Therefore, having fewer children and encouraging **IMMIGRATION** is surely the approach we should adopt. Unfortunately, selfishness, xenophobia and bigotry seem to dominate views on this topic.Also, in relation to climate change and environmental degradation, children and adults in Western developed nations consume many times more planet resources than do children and adults in developing countries. If we are to save humanity (and yes, it is as serious as that) we must either consume a lot less or have fewer children (probably both). Again, **IMMIGRATION** can solve many of the problems of a declining population and can help those in countries badly affected by climate change. We need a huge attitude shift but, as Polly says, older people tend in general to be more frightened of change and more likely to be anti-**IMMIGRATION**. So, an ageing society is a barrier to solutions relating to reducing the number of highly expensive consumers and facilitating climate-related migration. Finally, there is the mistaken assumption that having a smaller population means everyone earns more. This is a very simplistic assumption based on historical precedents like the financial benefits the peasants saw after the Black Death. Of course, today we compete on a global scale with countries that have huge populations and therefore lots of cheap labour. We can't opt out of this global competition. Being a member of the EU was beneficial in this respect because of freedom of movement and the migration of cheap labour to the UK (which was also beneficial to those migrant workers because they could earn more in the UK than they could at home (even at minimum wage rates)). The upshot is that we need to be more sophisticated and strategic in how we approach the birth rate in the light of climate change and environmental degradation. We also need to change our attitude to **IMMIGRATION** as it is far more of a solution than a problem to the challenges we face in coming years. In fact, as the migrants will come, whether we like it or not, it is vital that we plan for the mass movement of peoples who can no longer survive as a result of climate change.\n",

      "The countries with the best child care policies in Scandinavia have varying success in this regard. Norway and Finland have a slightly lower birth rate than the UK, while Sweden and Denmark have a slightly higher rate. All five countries though had much higher rates up until the 1970s when women entered the workplace in high numbers and the rate dropped significantly, with occasional up turns when the economy boomed dropping back straight back as soon as it cooled down. The more women become educated and able to secure good jobs in the economy the less inclined they are to have children. This is a universal norm and independent of child care provision by the state. The obvious conclusion is that to maintain a sustainable population a country needs to attract immigrants. **IMMIGRATION** is contentious though and can lead to disharmony so the best way to square this is to make the **IMMIGRATION** progress work selfishly for the host country, so the benefits are obvious and undeniable (something like the successful Canadian **IMMIGRATION** model). Obviously this approach is problematic for some on the left as it means categorising potential candidates into high, medium and low quality applicants. It's also problematic for some on the right as it means that the immigrants that do get accepted are not likely to play the role of the subservient immigrant, happy to work for less pay in poor conditions, and unwilling to take the blame for failed domestic policy making.\n",

      "Fertility is hard to estimate. You only know how many children a woman is going to have when she can no longer have any. Measuring fertility in the UK on that basis last give a figure above 1.8 for fertility. The estimate of 1.6 that Polly quotes includes assumptions about how many children women currently of reproductive age are going to have in future, based on their age. While some attempt is made to account for the fact that women are having babies later, I think it doesn't fully capture that. So 1.6 is likely an underestimate - I would guess the true figure is closer to 1.7 or a bit more.\n",
      "The other quoted figure of around 1.4 is even more dodgy, based on a pandemic year. Sure, 1.6 or 1.7 is still below replacement rate, but there is also the fact that life expectancy is rising, and the number of years of good health is also rising. So the population is in little danger of falling, and some of the demographic problems will have to be addressed by us working longer, gradually rising to 70 over the next decade or two.\n",

That the birth rate has fallen off a cliff is hardly surprising given the sky-high housing costs and job insecurity which exist in the UK today. But no-worries because the same politicians have a ready neoliberal solution to this problem, which is simply to \"off-shore\" the production of new people through massive and unremitting levels of net **IMMIGRATION**. There is one slight problem however, which is that such high rates of adult population replacement inevitably result in cultural replacement as well. The politicians have made a virtue out of necessity and proclaimed the benefits of \"multi-culturalism\" but we already see the beginnings of \"culture wars\" in the UK.

In other words, groundless xenophobia is the primary factor driving resistance to **IMMIGRATION**, as it pretty much always has been, and the notion that politicians are merely responding to 'valid concerns' is a fiction. You don't overcome xenophobia by pandering to it. We don't need a points system to manage **IMMIGRATION**- it'd make little or no difference at all to peoples attitudes to **IMMIGRATION**, as they aren't generally grounded in reality.

The only way to escape this loop is if politicians have the courage to openly tie pension provision to the existence of a labour pool capable of sustaining it.

It is also the case that as societies grow richer birth rates reduce due to better survival rates, and better access to education and birth control.

      "Excellent post. I agree with you. Polly is scaremongering. If not for **IMMIGRATION**, the UK population would decline gradually, not catastrophically. With **IMMIGRATION**, it will rise gradually. Spain, Italy and Japan have the same option available to them. But again, even if they choose not to avail themselves of it, their population decline will be pretty gradual, even though their average fertility is lower than the UK - substantially so in the case of Japan.\n",
      "It also takes a long time for demographic change to happen. Preferences, and fertility, can change faster than that. Though I admit that it is hard to see any reason why fertility would rise significantly anytime soon.\n",

      "I feel like people are severely underestimating how bad the aging crisis is going to be. A world where the consumer base is shrinking instead of the growing which is all we've ever known collapses the economic model of every export-led economy. We've yet to see the full consequences, but the Spanish and Italian pension crises will be illustrative. While I'd agree that overpopulation is a major problem for the planet, what is required is a managed decrease over time. A birth rate of 1.4 is disastrous, and **IMMIGRATION** is a sticking plaster solution. A country where the economy shrinks every year is nothing to look forward to\n",
