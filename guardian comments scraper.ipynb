      "Read the comments. I just said what I thought and others have started to say that I am wrong, as if there is only one way of seeing this. I have not said I am right but others are convinced this is a bad idea, so why isn’t there some balance here? I am struck by how many identikit comments condemning this new scheme. The issue here is that it is not about right or wrong because this subject will always be debatable. Until tue maths provision is put in place and its effectiveness tracked over several years would anyone have some authoritative data. Even then people won’t always agree. \n",
      "As for my experience, I was at school from the 1980s and 1990s. I went to sixth form college, and then did a BA and two Ma’s. I also worked at schools, and have had nieces and nephews going to state schools. My own kids go to school now, and the education provision has changed considerably from my time. Teachers are much more caring for a start. Most people here seem to be relating their experiences of what schools were like decades ago and have no recent experience of being at school. They have little experience of seeing what is taught at schools today because it is is obvious many people here don’t have children at school now.From reception age, kids are given more Maths support than they used to in the 1980s and 1990s. My primary school aged children are given many Maths related games that sharpen those skills and enrol them in a type of national competition. Kids thoroughly enjoy that, and it often it means kids get ahead of what they were learning. Children at primary school age never used to get homework but now they are given lots of Maths work to do at home. Teachers have dedicated classes for pupils who struggle with maths so they could catch up with the students who are at the level they should be at their age. \n",
      "You said this: “..this government is one which is not naturally associated with spreading opportunity to all, so I’m inclined to view this aspiration cynically.”It is well know that many readers of the Guardian are richer people, middle and upper classes. It is conceivable that many people reading here send their kids to private schools, pay for extra tuition and see the advanced fields in Maths, sciences and computing as something that was reserved for their children. I am cynical that people here genuinely care about this initiative and see it as a way of poorer children getting greater access to education that might qualify them to enter high earning professions in science technology and engineering. I rewrote my cynicism as I sometimes feel there is a big difference between Guardian readers and commentators. I find it often that people on this website often bash progressive initiatives, and in some cases even repeat the extreme views found on The Daily Mail website. \n",
      "Only time will tell if Maths will help or not, but there have been quite a few articles about this subject here over the last week, most of them very critical, and with very negative comments. I mean, sure , it is OK to be be a bit cynical but the reaction in this paper is bordering on the hysterical. I am not just talking about this article here, but all the ones published here combined. The vast majority of comments on this subject have been pretty hostile, and I find that strange because I am not sure if this is the worst this party has even announced. It is almost as if people have an agenda here to discredit this initiative to the detriment of the students who may benefit and get access to the kids of fields rich kids used to enter. In all likelihood the government. won’t even pay for this extra education anyway, and I think that some advanced Maths skills, which would usually only be affordable to richer parents, is truly a good thing, even if it is down by the wrong people or the wrong government. I am more concerned if this is an empty pledge than thinking it won’t be beneficial.\n",

      "I do think that what is considered an acceptable level for mathematics as an essential core subject for life in the modern world is too low in the UK I don't have experience in other nations, though I've not found too many Europeans with the sub standard I see often here. There are cultural gender issues, (Oh it's OK to be bad at math you're a girl for example) cultural class issues a sort of working class snobbery against academic pursuits. In my life I have met a lot of older children and young adults who just believe that they're not capable of doing math to any significant standard, and it seems that they've been taught to believe they're mentally incapable.\n",
      "Now I have tried many times with many people to explain that the brain is just like a muscle, if you exercise and challenge it as a routine, it will grow strong and sharp. Maths is just one of the best logical exercises you can do. And I do not believe that anyone who is physically healthy coudln't attain the ability and confidence in math to an A-Level standard. I remember being absolutely hopeless at times tables in primary school, and falling behind my peers. I remember feeling inadequate and like I just wasn't capable. The real reason I was behind was the teaching style didn't fit me - having it all written out on a board then chanting through the list as a class wasn't getting it into my brain. It wasn't until my late Grandfather who was a math teacher at a secondary school got me to draw out a grid with the numbers down each axis, then work each box out multiplying one by one a write the answer in - once I'd done that maybe 5 or 6 times? I never had any problem with times tables again. I also saw patterns in that grid of numbers that were not at all apparent before.\n",

      "Coming from abroad, I keep being shocked by the UK's school system. First I find out that 20% of the people drop out at 16 and then I find out that only 50% of the people have any maths past 16. This is the 21st century, people! I know people here like telling themselves fairy tales about how kids should never do any homework or tests or ever be intellectually challenged in any way in case they are scared for life, that university is about meeting people from different backgrounds and \"experimenting\" and not about learning or that the only intellectual skills worth acquiring are indistinguishable from those of an opinion piece writer or ChatGPT, and the rest have had enough of experts and have \"other skills\" and \"are good at working with their hands\". If it they do end up actually not got at anything, it's probably the class system that's done it, never a failing on the part of any person, family or community. \n",
      "I mean, come on! It's not the 1970s anymore - the human knowledge has gotten far beyond the point where you can afford to not push for more learning in schools. Not just maths, mind you! I don't know what's going on here, but despite spending the most years and most hours in schools compared to any other country I know, people in the UK are by far the worst educated and least aware of the world. Some of it is the curriculum, but a lot of this must be the \"culture\" and this needs challenging. \n",
      "The country that wants the NHS and might even want a good education system, doesn't want to pay more tax as it's milking the last of the empire dividends, scraping by thanks to taxes on financial services, sticky tape, immigration and prayer is not self-sustaining. Fixing badly installed boilers in badly built houses and spending the money on getting your hair cut doesn't pay for the imported food someone stacked on the shelves in Tesco, nor medicine, tech, schools for your children, doctors or care homes. Something has to give, but while maths alone won't do it, most people would rather claim their free cactus than consider what really needs improving in education so that Britain might one day become a productive and healthy society.\n",

      "This rather suggests that the problem is with maths teaching / developement of numeracy between ages 11 and 16, doesn’t it?”\n",
      "Then obviously Maths classes have to be improved and they have been doing that for the last 10 years at least, with additional Maths clubs, interactive apps like Timestables Rock Stars and Num Bots. This new scheme is building upon what schools Shevardnadze been doing for the last several years at primary and secondary schools. You won’t see the improvements in statistics overnight, and the 70% of adults you refer to obviously include people who went to school decades ago. The vast majority of people commenting here neither have kids nor have seen the inside of a school for decades, but education provision in Uk schools has changed considerably over the last 10-15 years and children are learning far more maths than they used to. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, children did not even get homework in primary school but they do now. Your comment is staggeringly ignorant and you don’t understand why they are planning to add two more years of Maths. The reason is that many children don’t go on and study Maths for their A-Levels and since they don’t all these students usually can’t take subjects for which advanced Maths is a requirement. These classes will give students the confidence that they can do Maths at more advanced levels and then hopefully study subjects that require these skills. Students who will get additional Maths lessons will be able to handle them because they are already being given very good Maths tuition at school, and you will see the positive results of this in time, not next week. Nothing changes overnight but all positive steps to improve things don’t show immediate improvements, and your 60% of adults, who aren’t at school now, and obviously won’t benefit from any improvements at schools, should not be your focus. You should look at what is being done at schools now and how that would be beneficial in the future.\n",

      "You don’t get it. Most kids, especially younger ones don’t particularly care for time as adults do. Their day is often regimented and they do things when they are told, regardless of what time it is. Parents, teachers and care givers always tell kids it’s time to do something and the kids do it then. Do they know what time it is on the clock? It wouldn’t matter if they did because they still have to do what they are supposed to at that time. Adults are responsible for time keeping, and they need to know the time, and when it starts to become necessary to read the time, kids learn to do it because it begins to have meaning and consequences. All adults can tell the time and that is because they know it is important to be on time (though Marilyn Monroe famously had no concept of it).Same with money. Children don’t buy or seek things. They do5 really care how to count money or what it is for, until they start to get some and then quickly figure it out. You can teach people lots of things at school that have meaning for adults, but children might understand its importance, it is a skill they cannot internalise because it is not of any use to them. In the old days many young children understood money better because poor parents might send Theo kids to buy stuff. Some even had to work at a young age. Things are different now. Just because you can observe kids without certain skills, doesn’t mean a lack of those skills has anything to do with their ability or intelligence. Many old people can’t use apps or mobile smartphones but once they know that they have no choice, they quickly figure it out. It is the same idea. Schools place emphasis on things like subtraction, multiplication and division in the early years. Telling the time doesn’t fluffier much because kids don’t really refer to the time much at all.\n",

      "“Maths is hugely important, certainly the closest thing we have found to the language of the Universe but it is both not necessary to have this sort of detailed knowledge of most areas of maths for most people…”\n",
      "That is precisely the reason why it should be taught to lost people so they have the confidence to go into many socially beneficial fields in the sciences, computing and engineering. This can effectively extend people’s options by training them up, building their confidence and hoping they would feel more able to do subjects that are viewed as being difficult. Of all people leaving schools have much more advanced skills than present, it can’t be a bad thing because such a society is more prepared to make use of skills you think are not necessary for “most people”. They are not necessary at present because people don’t have them, so can’t make use of them. Your reasoning is flawed and somewhat irrational. You obviously have to train people to you see the results, you can’t say people don’t have those skills and that is proof they won’t benefit people. Guardian reader demographics show that it is mostly read by more affluent and rich people, and to me it seems they use politics to keep the plebs in their place, so their rich kids could have the whole cake of the advanced fields to themselves. They just don’t want kids to learn more advanced skills at school, lest their privately schooled kids, lose their edge in higher earning professions. Yes, teach less Maths to keep poorer children in their place because “most people have no need for it”. Well, how would you know if they have need for it or not? Let them get the skills and they will show you what need there is, thank you very much. Thanks for your concerns.\n",

      "Sorry to differ with you but I have seen an enormous drive, especially at primary schools, to improve maths. Over the last two years children have also been getting Maths classes over the summer and Christmas breaks. I have seen children being born more games based learning where they are made competitive with other children, and having children of primary school age at schools, we hear every week how much statistical difference has been made in improving Maths skills. Perhaps you don’t agree with the way this Maths education is revised but it has yielded excellent results. In primary schools you often have children who fall behind of rind it hard and schools are now sending these kids to dedicated classes to improve their skills and get back to the level they need to be. I went to school in the 1980s and 1990s and it was not like this. You either got it, or you didn’t. Hardly anyone got extra help, classes. Maths provision has been criticised for years, but the positive steps taken won’t show a statistical difference for a long time because we have to track people through different ages etc. If further improvements need to be made, they will always start with a politician saying that the changes must occur. To prematurely condemn anyone taking the steps to improve Maths provision in the UK is irrational. If the UK, in spite of being one of the richest countries in the world, is behind other countries in Maths, any initiatives designed to improve this should be considered positive. This government spends a lot of public money by enriching their friends, so anything they do to extend advanced Maths skills to more people is to be welcomed. That does not mean this plan cannot be revised and improved.\n",

These were considered the \"handmaids\" of Theology as the master subject (\"ancillae theologiae\"). That is why you can get a Bachelor of Arts in Maths, Physics, Chemistry or Biology.* Gradually in the course of the 19th and 20th centuries subjects were resolved into big groups and university faculties, with Science for the natural sciences (pushing most other forms of knowledge and research out of the concept \"science\" in the English language, which creates problems in translating into and out of e.g. German) and tending to co-opt Maths; Medicine as self-explanatory; Theology (see above); and the rest as a rag bag under \"Arts\". \n",
      "* In have just looked at my old school list, and the Maths and Science masters all had \"M.A.\" or \"B.A.\" after their names (, except those who studies at universities other than Oxford or Cambridge, who were \"M.Sc.\" or \"B.Sc\". Obviously Oxbridge stuck to the mediaeval terminology in the naming of degrees, and at least some newer universities did not.\n",

      "My observation, as an Irish person with a Comp. Sci. degree from 1983 (!) is that the English (Scottish is better) education system is extremely class-based and has relegated a large proportion of the population to a dependent 'lower class' with little education and thus no means to participate productively in a modern knowledge-based economy.\n",
      "My English husband, also with a Comp Sci degree from the '80s from what was then an English PolyTech (now a University), tells of how he and his classmates, at a Comprehensive school in Leicester in the late 1970s/early 1980s , were presented with practical 'engineering' subjects like technical drawing rather than more academic subjects at O Level - as they were being groomed for a life of employment in the local industry workshops. None were pushed to complete their education to age 18 / A-Level. Luckily for my husband, his Indian father had the strong immigrant's drive to push his son towards further education - and prevailed. He went on to gain A-Level Maths and his subsequent degree. A very profitable career in the IT industry in the US and UK ensued.(His Indian father also advised leaving the UK if he wanted to advance).\n",
      "My 'working-class' husband's story of how he escaped the English class-based education system has a sad coda - his classmates to age 16 did not, and after leaving school with O Levels they have scraped a living in low-level jobs or on unemployment benefit - never leaving Leicester, which lost most of the industry they were groomed for, in the Thatcher years.\n",
      "The UK's persistent lack of productivity and growth can be traced directly to its not-fit-for-purpose, class-based education system.\n",

      "People don’t always do what the government tells them and there are numerous arts and humanities subjects you can study at sixth form and university. I should know because I studied one of those. Where does it show that studying Maths will be at the expense of picking a humanities subject, given there are dedicated colleges and universities for the arts and universities? Is there evidence that more maths will lead to fewer students taking humanities? Are studies in advanced subjects that require Maths, and currently taken by fewer students, worse than the humanities? Do we need more sociologists, than engineers of people doing advanced physics that may one day help cure cancer? Do we need more people dissecting the meaning of a Kubrick movie (as if you need a fucking degree for that), than skills that might one day lead to people create new technology that even fits everyone? As for the Kubrick thing, it wasn’t a joke. I was in a class that made the obvious comparisons between Homer’s the Odyssey, and Kubrick’s 2001. Did you know that Hal was a bit like the Minotaur? It had one eye, was misunderstood and killed people? Woah, now that I know that, it would benefit everyone. The humanities will still have students, as many as society needs will be there to do whatever they end up doing. In the meantime, many of society’s problems will be solved by people that get into subjects that require more advanced Maths, things like engineering, computing, and various sciences. Also, extra maths does not mean people won’t make their own choices as to what to study at university. Your argument is poor.\n",

      "I have some level of maths / number blindness. I cannot reliably copy out a phone number. I CAN do basic mental arithmetic and not get ripped off while sale shopping, and that's about it. I have an average GCSE maths grade - the least I could get without needing a resit. I just assumed I cannot maths. I would have been horrified to have to do an additional two years OF THE SAME THING (which is what it amounts to. )BUT THEN... I did post graduate study which required a compulsory statistics module. I was so terrified by this, that I actually explained to the professor that I really didn't think I would be able to do his course and was, therefore, the whole course unsuitable for me (this module had never come up in the interview for my PhD study) He reassured me that he was SURE he could teach me all the statistics I would need, and told me that I should not worry because it is a shame that secondary school maths teachers allow children to assume they cannot cope with ALL of maths. Turns out, his course was absolutely revelatory to me, and I passed, and I learnt SO much maths. I will never claim in any way to be good at it, but I can confidently apply myself to some research and understand what is going on and where the pitfalls might be. Because, as it turns out, statistics is NOT about numbers. It LOOKS like numbers, but really, it's just people, or things or whatever. I would never foist more of the same secondary maths on anyone, but I WOULD say, being taught not to be scared and to look at maths in. different way can be life changing\n",

      "Numeracy is low level - there’s nothing wrong with using a calculator. Rough mental estimation is a more important skill than accurate mental calculation. Most people don’t use cash so the change issue is irrelevant.It’s rare that geometry and angles are linked to clock faces because of the way the hands move around the clock. Digital time is fine so long as it is made clear that it isn’t base 10. Given that time isn’t base 10, the analogue clock is of little use for understanding percentages.So long as people know how to use a calculator properly and how to mentally estimate an answer so they can check whether they have used it properly, it’s actually far more important that they learn how to think mathematically and how different parts of mathematics link together and can be used to analyse and solve puzzles, including those involved in building things, assessing risks etc etc etc. It’s also important to understand statistics and how they relate to the real world - playing about manually finding the range, mean, median etc of a small group of numbers is a pointless task - they need to use computers to deal with statistically significant datasets.We live in a technological age - we should be using technology to do the grunt work and the extra time to develop deeper understanding and applications. For younger children we should be using equipment they can move around and develop their ability to order and spot patterns in order to develop an instinctive understanding of numbers and pattern before moving to formal written methods.\n",

      "Exactly. These commentators here just have different agenda. Seems they just don’t want educational privileges extended to poorer people. Remember many of the advanced sciences, Maths and engineering jobs are extremely well paid, and mostly go to people from richer people. To improve Maths provision to everyone means all those rich parents paying for their kids to get extra Maths classes are worried the plebs might catch up. Every time there is an article over education, you will find there is no difference between commentators here than at the Daily Mail, where people start saying there is no point in offering extra education to people, or that more people should take apprenticeships to train for speed of trades, and leave the loftier jobs to an undefined group of people. I wonder who those are. Probably the kids of the rich politically motivated rich people who comment on The Guardian. They pretend to be friends of the poor but if you look at this article, they are actually discouraging the teaching of a subject that leads to people getting into subjects that pay well. Richer people spend their money to get their kids ahead and they don’t want everyone to be the same because then their extra money teaching their kids goes to waste and wealth offers no advantage. “What? I can’t even use my money now to get my kid an unfair advantage because the plebs are now going to be true training for free?” Fuck it, let’s just say it is the dumb government on The Guardian and convince the progressives it is a bad idea!”\n",

      "“You should perhaps stick to topics you are familiar with.” Perhaps you should take your own advice after your daft comment about kids and their parents and clocks. Do you have children? Most of the time children hardly ever refer to times because they are supervised all the time and are told to do things at certain time of day, so they don’t need to learn the time. As they get older, and they do, they figure it out because by that point, that clock has some meaningful information to convey. You don’t look at the reasons for why certain things might be the way they are, you imply kids and Theo parents are incapable of telling the time, without any real evidence of any kind, and then ask me to stick to the subjects I understand? Quite silly really.I actually had a conversation with a teacher at primary school and I asked why don’t they teach children to tell the time, and I was told that many children don’t have a concept of time and it wouldn’t mean much to them because they don’t independently do things by liking at what time is on the clock. The children eventually pick it up. When a school announces it is lunchtime, the kids know it is, it wouldn’t matter what it says on the clock because they are not expected to lol a true time and independently make their way to the dinner hall. That is true for most other things they do, until they start doing things independently and have to time keep. That is when they thing “oh, that”’s what it is really for!”\n",

      "A fascinatingly reductive perspective. Of course it is certainly true that one can learn anything one chooses, including mathematics or crochet, at any age and a jolly good thing too. Fortunately that fact alone doesn't determine what we choose to teach in schools.That is decided by an assessment of what creates opportunities for individuals when they enter the labour market as well as what is useful to society - or more crudely to UK plc. In the modern world society is increasingly reliant on technology underpinned by maths so it deserves consideration on both counts if we want to have skin in the game. That game is played out across the world in many languages though and it is no longer possible to get by by just SPEAKING VERY LOUDLY at people in English. Knowing other languages opens doors to employment and exciting careers both here and overseas for individuals, and improves the UK's ability to operate in overseas markets. It's a valuable economic asset to the country.Since the idea of making maths compulsory to 18 is at least in part driven by what other countries do maybe it's worth looking at the other things, like languages, that they do better than us. We are competing against them after all aren't we.The very idea of Global Britain outside the EU as promoted by the Brexit faction pretty much demands that we become good at foreign languages to make that a reality anyway. Why would anyone on any side of the political divide object.\n",

      "Maths is a very important subject and other countries are better than us at delivering it but so are modern languages which the UK is undeniably appallingly bad at. Shouldn't every child leave school fluent in at least one other language? Let's have a bun fight over which is more important! Or maybe just go both. But how?Before getting to that though - since Rish! is so hot on making things add up he could not have made this statement without realising that to add any compulsory subject - maths or anything else - into the curriculum for 16-18 year olds will require a wholesale change in the structure of the 'A level years'. 16-18 actually means 4 terms of fresh teaching since the summer exams these days start in early May meaning that the Lent term is necessarily given over to revision. Getting through the curriculum of three A Levels in 4 terms is hard enough so where is a maths module going to fit? How many hours a week? Will it be examined? How much revision time will be allotted? What will be sacrificed from other subjects to create the time?Seen in that way Rishi! is actually proposing a move to a BL type of sixth form curriculum which will allow a broader education up to 18 with scope for making certain things compulsory. Which is of course how those crafty Europeans manage to do it. Clever. Let the culture wars begin!Also to consider will be those that leave school at 16. Will they be required to take the same courses/exams?\n",

      "You are very wrong. First of all, for the last several years, schools have stepped up Maths provisions at schools in the UK, anyone with children at school will tell you there is much more focus on Maths than there used to be. To imply children are not learning any Maths is patently wrong. The additional Maths classes Mr Sunak wants schools to provide would be for older students between the ages of 16-18, in the hope that they will learn more advanced Maths skills and then might be encouraged to enter fields that require strong Maths skills. Since not all school leavers currently progress on to Maths at college, few go on to learn subjects that require advanced Maths skills. If students learn more advanced Maths at ages 16-18, this would qualify them to choose subjects where Maths is essential. It will broaden students’ options after leaving school. Whether this makes sense or not is up for debate, but you seem to be saying that Maths provision in general is poor. Regardless of what happens, or whether this new scheme works or not, your perception that kids in the UK are not taught Maths or that “schooling is horrifically inefficient”, is wrong, and you insult the teachers and students at school. The teachers are advised by the government what to teach, and they do so professionally and with dedication. There is always room for improvement but all children, even in private schools, follow the same curriculum.\n"
