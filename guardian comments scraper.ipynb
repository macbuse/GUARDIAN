      "Not only did almost all Leavers demand that the June 2016 EU vote was recognised but so many Remainers too. It was just bad taste and not British to, in effect, claim that a one-off was a two-legged affair and that pissed off many a Remainer-voter as well. That so many went to the mat to defend that vote but some will wave through a re-run of a referendum from just a year and 10 months earlier? Crazy talk. One shouldn't shit on the 2014 'No, Thanks' vote as one shouldn't befoul the 2016 Leave vote.\n",
      "Britons decide what happens to Britain: that was the Brexit theory of the case. If there was another one and it was a Yes vote then the rest of Britain would be turned into a de facto one-party (Tory) state, not by Westminster, not by Brussels but by a state north of the country. Not only that but such a result would be achieved with the rest of Britain being able to vote to the contrary. Utter bollocks and shame on anyone trying to wave this through who isn't a nationalist bonehead. \n",
      "Al Johnson might be thinking that it's his job to keep the country together; that the 2014 vote has to be recognised like the 2016 referendum; that Brexit means nothing if Britain's future can be dictated by (soon to be) non-Britons, if Scotland had a re-run and voted yes. \n",
      "Pretty simple and that's without talk on how there would have to be a hard border with the north of England; how an \"independent\" Scotland wouldn't have the leverage to refuse the Euro since no one would believe that it would walk away in protest; that keeping the pound would negate spitting from Britain since the City of London would still, in reality, be in charge and it wouldn't be allowed anyway; how the austerity to join the EU and then keep within the 3% deficit of GDP as demanded by the EU's Growth and Stability Pact would be brutal beyond imagination; that becoming the \"new Greece\", a burned-out husk of neoliberal gangsterism, should be no one's aim, if they love their country; that becoming a tiny fish in the neoliberal lake of the EU doesn't compare with being a big fish in the British pond. \n",
      "One wonders how many of the London media who give the SNP such a constantly easy ride wouldn't dream of living in Scotland so couldn't care less if it became a neoliberal hellscape but their Scottish birth/parentage/grandparentage would give them an eventual EU passport and \"victory\" over the Leave voters?

      "A revealing slip, which itself says rather a lot.\n",
      "Partliamentary Sovereignty is purely a concept in English Law (not UK Law). Martin is confusing legislation with \"the Law\", and doesn't seem to understand that the UK consists of three separate legal jurisidictions, with very different underlying constitutional principles.\n",
      "In short, in England sovereignty is derived from the monarch, but exercised by the aristocracy) in modern terms, parliament) because centuries ago, some Barons had a rebellion and held the King hostage. Yoiu can see the same thing today with the power exercised by the press barons. But sovereignty does not rest with ordinary people in England.\n",
      "Scots Law follows the European norm, in that soveresignty rests with the people, and the monarchy exists purely on the sufferance of the people. If for example, Scotland decided to rid of Mrs Windsor, and replace her Meghan Markle, that would entirely legal under Scots Law. In fact it has already happened historically, although obviously different individuals were involved.\n",
      "Under the Act of Union, Scots and English Law have equal status, and yet this doesn't seem to taught or understood in English schools, leading to the mistaken belief that English Law or concepts such as \"parliamentary sovereignty\" have legal weight outside the borders of England and Wales. They do not.\n",
      "Of course in UK terms it creates a thorny constitutional problem, but it really isn't helpful for English journalists, to talk as if they have annexed another country, and subsumed its own legal system and constituional principles.\n",
      "In fact it is one of the things that has always puzzled me. If people like Martin were seriously concerned about preserving the Union, why on earth do they not teach these things in English schools?\n",

      "Assuming that is not a rhetorical question, it depends what you mean by saying \"England was ignored\" and what you think the purpose of devolution was. Scottish independence was designed as a tactical manoeuvre by New Labour to head off the risk from the SNP. (Ha! That worked well.) \n",
      "Welsh devolution was added on in order to make it a bit less obvious that devolution to Scotland was just party politicking dressed up as constitutional reform. There was little groundswell for Welsh devolution, and the Welsh assembly was authorised by a tiny majority on a very low turnout.Devolution to London was also part of this. It was offered to the North East of England too, which voted against it, and Blair promptly gave up on any more constitutional reform, leaving the rest of England as it was. The truth is he was never interested in devolution as a project, only for its tactical political advantage.\n",
      "Although I am in favour of all that devolution and more, I am cynical enough to acknowledge that Blair never even proposed devolution for Tory-voting areas. \n",
      "Some say there should be an English Parliament, by analogy with the Welsh Senned and Scottish Parliament. Personally I see no point in that. In my view devolution should bring govt closer to the people. An English parliament would cover 85% of the UK population, so it would be no nearer or more responsive than Westminster. Real English devolution means the creation of at least half a dozen regions, with relevant assemblies and powers. Johnson and the tories have no interest in that. They want to concentrate power in their own hands. Taking back control indeed!\n",

      "I was 17 in 1998. I remember NI before the signing of the Good Friday Agreement. I remember the bombs (there was one in the housing estate I lived in) and I remember the paramilitary murders (my friend's dad was the subject of attempted murder). I remember the British Army checkpoints, I remember the riots, I remember the sectarianism. I witnessed the long and painful road to peace. I moved to Belfast to attend university in 1999. It was a city transformed. No more bombs, no more checkpoints. Then, 18 years later, in 2016, an Etonian fraud tables a cynical referendum as a means of neutering his own Europhobes and outflanking the clown Farage, after 6 years of subjecting the nation to a punishing, economically illiterate and politically motivated austerity programme. The campaign in support of leaving the EU engages in (quoting the Electoral Commission) \"multiple breaches of electoral law.\" Then the victorious wing of the Tory party pursues a ruinous version of Brexit for which they had no mandate, and which threatens the peace of this part of the island of Ireland. Despite this, the English seem quite content to continue to vote for the privileged authors of this insanity indefinitely. \n",

      "The implacable desire to centralise and control, and the crass, cavalier attitude to established conventions, makes the current UK government the biggest threat to the Union. They seem to lack the wit to realise that that which does not bend will break. \n",
      "Several weeks ago, in the days after Nicola Sturgeon was cleared of any wrong-doing, midst all the unionist hand-wringing and sanctimony, there was an article in the Guardian which revealed that according to voices within government, “Now the Conservatives must begin the work to keep the UK intact.”\n",
      "Yes indeed. It’s a real shame when vacuous slogans and mud-slinging don’t quite get the job done. \n",
      "It will be interesting to see how the UK government will defend the Union. There is talk of a detailed assessment being made of the impact on Scotland should they leave …... how the erection of new borders can “impact trade and family ties”. Johnson and his Brexity courtiers will have a lot of credibility in setting out that case, I’m sure.\n",
      "The reality is that Johnson has neither the intelligence, the subtlety nor the application required to finesse a working solution to the problems the Union now faces. To add to his obvious incompetence, he is a horribly divisive and belligerent figure with not a shred of credibility.\n",
      "He is the wrong man, at the wrong time, in the wrong place pursuing the wrong thing.Unless, of course, you’re judging him from the perspective of the SNP or Irish Nationalists. In which case, he is a god-send.\n",

      "Johnson's impact upon NI is indicative of his character, so well described by Max Hastings in this paper a year or two back. He isn't a serious politician. He's keen on self aggrandisement and whilst happy to be a bully when holding all the cards, prefers to avoid criticism by basically telling people what they would prefer to hear. Regardless of link to fact or truth. \n",
      "So Johnson's attitude to NI - the expectation that he could promise many things and not deliver once elected - and an inability to understand the nuances that were required to make the GFA work - will be just like his attitude to Scotland. That Scotland might vote for the opportunity for independence will mean little to a man for whom truth and honesty are just details. It can only be about what suits Johnson's advantage. And what catches his tendency to spend other people's money, to look good. \n",
      "Whether or not there is a divide between Westminster and Scotland is hard to know definitively, as with 11 years of Tory England centric Tory rule, who knows what options might have been possible. Whether or not there were options probably doesn't matter now as Scotland might be thinking that an independent country looking to link to the EU, even if disadvantaged economically in the short/medium term, is a better option than being a region ignored, within a Union very far from being equals. \n",

      "Larry Elliot never once saw the EU in anything but economic terms, my German family never thought of it in that way. It is peculiar blindness of limited minds, to see the EU yet completely miss what its founders intended it to become.\n",
      "Not a single European state, nation-states are part of the EU, just like Kent is part of England. In most things, nation-states are still perfectly viable and can do most things interaly. However, beyond that, they join together in an EU of nation-states, to share sovereignty when it suits them.\n",
      "The EU is not intended to replace nation-states, it is supposed to join these states for the common purpose of creating a better future. \n",
      "I never believed one small planet cut up into 200 odd countries, all saying they have absolute sovereignty, of their part of earth's ecosystem, was even sane. \n",
      "The EU is an experiment to see if this genuinely shared sovereignty can be made to work, if it fails the whole concept will be lost for this century. It is that important for the future.\n",

      "I dont think it is either fair or accurate to put the 'woes' of the Union at Boris' door. What most commentators down south do not realise is that by casting independence in Scotland as a 'problem' or a 'worry' or a 'loss' they ignore something very fundamental. Scotland has always been quasi-autonomous. This was lost during the 20th century, largely down to the world wars, and a generation after the war and succeeding ones have never read Scotland or understood it at all. This is at the heart of the growing displeasure with the Union in Scotland. We are seen as a 'problem' to be fixed, not a partner. We are told time and time again those voting for independence are 'separatists' or union-wreckers, yet, no-one understands it is not about breaking anything but calling time on a union that stopped being a union many decades ago. Scotland is treated with utter contempt, and has been for many many years now, to the point we are viewed as recalcitrant traitors rather than a people in their own country, fed up with the drip drip negative treatment of a once very proud nation. We are no longer seen as a nation, nor as autonomous, and that is why the desire to get it back grows with every decade. It's not a problem. It's a solution.\n",

      "“The English majoritarian restraint that was so marked when governments were more sensitive to the need to accommodate differences is today like an abandoned house on the top of a crumbling cliff.”\n",
      "I think this is the key point. The existence of the Union was always based on the tacit understanding that the geopolitical benefit to England and the economic benefit to Scotland were worth both of them ignoring the things they didn’t like so much - it’s easily forgotten that the Union was very unpopular in both countries when it first happened and really only came into effect as a joint enterprise and popular cause in the 19th c. at the height of empire. But if the “British” government, consisting almost entirely of English MPs, no longer sees enough geopolitical value in the Union to accommodate the cultural difference, and the Scots believe there is another, European, Union that offers an economic alternative - where’s the common interest? Yes, we can’t ignore the deep family and social connections (I speak as a Scot long resident in England), but is that enough? The absence of a political union doesn’t seem to hinder the same links between England and Ireland.\n",

      "Scotland really should be independent. Scotland WILL become independent, it is inevitable, just look at all the other parts of Europe. Westminster claiming they can stop the scots from deciding their own fate \"by law\" is totally self-defeating, it will lay everything bare (and not only concerning Scotland). Even \"self-governance\" is an idea from the past. The question is simply how it happens. While making a mess about a lot of things, Cameron was right about allowing the vote. But then Westminster bungled it with the heavy-handed last-minute scare tactics & propaganda (focusing on \"economics\"), managing to win the vote but losing the chance to actually resolve the question at the same time. Independence was left smoldering, and then Brexit threw petrol on the coals. But just think for a minute, in what future will Scotland happily stay a part of the UK? And yes, there is the answer, since such a future does not exist (in the really real world). Brexit will hurt the UK a lot, which will hurt the money flowing to Scotland enormously, removing the only real reason to stay on as part of the UK. And yes, it really is Scotland's decision.\n",

      "whilst I agree with the narrative of this article it does leave one topic which no one as yet has answered of how the separation would be achieved. Unlike Brexit, which has been badly handled by the British government, most of the entities were in place which would allow Britain to continue even if the separation from the EU turned out to be a shambles. Scotland, on the other hand, has nothing in place to function as a sovereign country. The most recent example appears to suggest they would like to continue with access to the BBC as they no state broadcaster. The SNP have dodged consistently which currency they would use, what defense strategy they will have in place they have no central bank the list just goes on and on. It could take tears of wrangling with Westminster to sort out even basic rules for leaving and don't even talk about the hard border and the effect on Scottish trade. I wish Westminster would show some leadership and insist the SNP lay out the terms of separation so that everyone could see the impact. 14 years in office and not once have they explained how to undo 300 years of union.\n",

      "I don't know of one. There would be much to decide in terms of independence beforehand. Currency, borders with England, etc. Closer relations with the EU could start immediately, however, with a view towards joining the European Free Trade Area. IT would take a few years, would be my guess, but Scotland would have reversed a slide into isolationism with England and turned itself back towards a cooperative multi-lateral relationship with all of its neighbours. The benefits would begin to accrue immediately, and English businesses, particularly exporters and financial firms would likely go north to Scotland. Scotland could consider and plan its own destiny without constantly being overruled by England. England too, could stand on its own two feet and learn politically to cooperate with other nations instead of constantly trying to dominate them. England isn't there yet, but Scotland leaving the Union would certainly help it see the light.\n"

Then when **BORIS**, spying a political opportunity mentions it, knowing he is revered figure for many, suddenly **BORIS** is starting a culture war. No he didn't start it, but he is capitalising on it. He is saying to a sizable demographic - look the left hate your heroes, your values, and let's face it you. Now the left may well be right, Churchill may have been awful through and through. But it is interesting that concerns over policing in the USA leads to attacks on British culture. Wouldn't it be better that we had all these articles about the utterly toothless and captured IOPC? Unless of course solving the problems of racism, comes second to telling people you hate them or the things they care about. But the left seem to be completely in denial about their role, that they are typically initiators. Even conspiracy theory levels of denial. I've had one even tell me that Churchill statue wasn't vandalised, the Mail made it up. \n",

Trump’s environmental agency simply removed the words climate change and global warming from its reports and that was enough for them. Now the Tory race report simply doesn’t bother with Windrush or Grenfell or a thousand other pieces of evidence, and that seems to satisfy exactly the sort of people who want to hear what they paid for.

Thus, denial is a powerful tool... and what better form of denial than to invent a culture war where everyone who thinks you're wrong is not smarter than you, but is in fact an agent of an enemy movement. This is certainly how Trump defended his fragile, narcissistic inferiority complex. Create a false enemy and a false dichotomy, claim that the enemy is malevolent and their concerns are manufactured, then look for support amongst others who also feel inferior, or at least need a non-objective reason to feel superior despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n",
