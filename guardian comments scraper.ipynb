      "I am fully vaccinated, but I also have an autoimmune disease not listed anywhere on the covid guidelines etc. My GP had no idea if the vaccine would make me feel worse or not. I decided to be vaccinated as I'm too keen on trying how it feels to have covid. However, with all the variants and the increase in community transmission, with even fully vaccinated people ending up in hospital, I'm really not too sure about \"starting to live again\", going to crowded events, eating in restaurants and pubs indoors... Herd immunity is a fantastic concept, if you don't get severely ill and if you don't have pre-existing conditions. There are plenty of people who don't \"look\" disabled or sick, but that are still genuinely concerned about ditching masks, safe distancing and so on, let alone the anxiety that some can experience when their employers tells them they need to go back to working in poorly ventilated offices, maybe even having to use crowded public transportation again, while they could carry on working from home just as efficiently as they've done for the past 16 months or so. I'm fully aware that other works cannot be done from home and plenty of people have risked their lives throughout the entire pandemic. I just think that \"starting to live again\" does not apply to everyone. For some, the more people \"live again\" and spread covid (albeit asymptomatically), the more they will NOT \"live again\" and may need to revert to shielding.\n",

This is a government that was ready to write off the vulnerable before the pandemic even took hold, yet we must now place our faith in those who most recently allowed the Delta variant into the country, responsible for the majority of the current levels of infection.\n",
      "It is frankly rational to be sceptical of such a government and its spokespeople, along with all of those who are (while understandably) sick of lockdown calling for reopening, when all they have spent 18 months doing is calling for reopening.

      "I think I’d prefer to have lived through Covid to WWII (based on what I know). I slept at night in my bed. The supermarkets remained open. There were no food shortages. Home take aways we’re easy enough to get. The internet was on. I could watch television. I read more. I spoke with other people everyday. Some face to face or mask to mask. Some by phone or video. I went walking. My dog was happier, he got walked and petted more. I worked from home. My salary was reduced but my employers had support so I am still in a job. My children are less happy. As am I. But we are ok. There has been laughter and joy. Sun shone. I swam in the sea. Anyone I know who got Covid sailed through. Thank goodness. I would say, if asked in years to come, what was The Pandemic like, I would say unpleasant. An interruption. But, on the whole, not the worse thing I have lived through. Like grandad’s cancer. Nana’s dementia. My young niece drowning. I’m sure everyone has their view. I honestly don’t feel I sacrificed too much. Given what I have. The return to normality if and when it arrives will bring with it some bad bits I’m sure that have been absent this past while. And good as well. Wish everyone here well.

      "I have had first hand experience of the good vaccines and the bad Public Health measures in the UK over the last month. First my 17 year old caught the virus after mixing with her peers with little protection offered by PH. Luckily she is very aware and sensible and isolated herself as soon as she thought there was a risk. It was confirmed 5 days later when her positive PCR came back. The remaining 3 of us in the house were double vaccinated with AZ and tested negative. We were contacted by Track and Trace but they didn't tell us anything my daughter hadn't already got us doing anyway. My son was frustrated that he couldn't go out so when he did he met friends and duly caught an infection and tested positive a week or so later. The vaccines have meant it is mild. We have all isolated. Track & Trace caught up with my daughter & partner but I haven't had anything. So I am actually not obliged to isolate. The vaccines are great and will go a long way to getting us through this. We still need a functioning Public Health system to do the job properly. It should go back to PH officers in local authorities. It is only Government ideology stopping that.\n",

Ow, the average Briton is far better protected than the average New Zealander or even Korean.\n",

OK - but that is rather the point of a vaccine though isnt it? You'll have to accept that it is possible to read your comment in the way of my original reading.

I agree we will need to accept living with the virus - but it will still kill people and make them ill. Vaccines will help - but it will never go away.

      "Has Professor Sridhar changed her mind. This from the link you provided seems to suggest a high degree of consistency on her part: \"\"The more the virus circulates, the more likely it is that mutations and variants will emerge, making it harder to suppress. The responsibility for this new variant can partly be attributed to those who argued against restrictions, believing that allowing the virus to run rampant in young people while shielding the vulnerable would allow immunity to develop. What they didn’t foresee is that such conditions are ripe for variants to emerge. Unless we suppress the virus, it will probably mutate further. This could make our current vaccines ineffective, or lead to reinfections.\"\"\n",

It is best to be neither complaisant nor overly comfortable with the period of current benefit in areas such as the UK or selected regions in the U.S. Quotes here include: Yogi Berra: \"The future ain't what it used to be.\" The essence of the business notes that time changes all and it may well alter the current situation from full relief to some temporary pause in the action.We need to learn that the Pandemic will be over only when it is and that is more up to the virus than it is to us in any ultimate sense.

      "You think that they're not as good as advertised because you don't understand what vaccines are for, or how they actually work. Vaccination is a statistical measure in that it reduces the percentage of people who overall will catch and pass on the disease, by both destroying the pool of infected that the illness needs to stay active in a population and reducing the statistical likelihood that the infected will suffer severe complications or die by bolstering the immune system; it is not a guarantee that you, personally, will not get ill, and never has been. For example, most childhood vaccines are 90-99% effective in preventing disease, and also tend to be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms. Most of those childhood vaccines have been in use for decades, and have been improved gradually for all of that time. None of them are perfect.

      "What's having serious consequences for other diseases, like cancer, is 11 years of NHS underfunding topped by an extremely poor and tardy pandemic response. When A+Es and ICUs fill up with Covid patients who need immediate care if they are not to die then there is less resource and staff time to treat other conditions, which whilst they may be very serious and debilitating are not immediately life-threatening (a person who literally cannot breathe needs treatment immediately or they will die). Also the more Covid patients there are in medical settings the less space there is, because of the need to stop non-Covid patients from being infected. If you want good treatment for cancer and other serious non-Covid illnesses then you need to vote for a government which will fund the NHS properly and which will suppress transmission of C19 rather than being content to let it run riot\n"

      "I am fully **VACC**inated, but I also have an autoimmune disease not listed anywhere on the covid guidelines etc. My GP had no idea if the **VACC**ine would make me feel worse or not. I decided to be **VACC**inated as I'm too keen on trying how it feels to have covid. However, with all the variants and the increase in community transmission, with even fully **VACC**inated people ending up in hospital, I'm really not too sure about \"starting to live again\", going to crowded events, eating in restaurants and pubs indoors... Herd immunity is a fantastic concept, if you don't get severely ill and if you don't have pre-existing conditions. There are plenty of people who don't \"look\" disabled or sick, but that are still genuinely concerned about ditching masks, safe distancing and so on, let alone the anxiety that some can experience when their employers tells them they need to go back to working in poorly ventilated offices, maybe even having to use crowded public transportation again, while they could carry on working from home just as efficiently as they've done for the past 16 months or so. I'm fully aware that other works cannot be done from home and plenty of people have risked their lives throughout the entire pandemic. I just think that \"starting to live again\" does not apply to everyone. For some, the more people \"live again\" and spread covid (albeit asymptomatically), the more they will NOT \"live again\" and may need to revert to shielding.\n",

      "I have had first hand experience of the good **VACC**ines and the bad Public Health measures in the UK over the last month. First my 17 year old caught the virus after mixing with her peers with little protection offered by PH. Luckily she is very aware and sensible and isolated herself as soon as she thought there was a risk. It was confirmed 5 days later when her positive PCR came back. The remaining 3 of us in the house were double **VACC**inated with AZ and tested negative. We were contacted by Track and Trace but they didn't tell us anything my daughter hadn't already got us doing anyway. My son was frustrated that he couldn't go out so when he did he met friends and duly caught an infection and tested positive a week or so later. The **VACC**ines have meant it is mild. We have all isolated. Track & Trace caught up with my daughter & partner but I haven't had anything. So I am actually not obliged to isolate. The **VACC**ines are great and will go a long way to getting us through this. We still need a functioning Public Health system to do the job properly. It should go back to PH officers in local authorities. It is only Government ideology stopping that.\n",

      "Has Professor Sridhar changed her mind. This from the link you provided seems to suggest a high degree of consistency on her part: \"\"The more the virus circulates, the more likely it is that mutations and variants will emerge, making it harder to suppress. The responsibility for this new variant can partly be attributed to those who argued against restrictions, believing that allowing the virus to run rampant in young people while shielding the vulnerable would allow immunity to develop. What they didn’t foresee is that such conditions are ripe for variants to emerge. Unless we suppress the virus, it will probably mutate further. This could make our current **VACC**ines ineffective, or lead to reinfections.\"\"\n",

      "You think that they're not as good as advertised because you don't understand what **VACC**ines are for, or how they actually work. **VACC**ination is a statistical measure in that it reduces the percentage of people who overall will catch and pass on the disease, by both destroying the pool of infected that the illness needs to stay active in a population and reducing the statistical likelihood that the infected will suffer severe complications or die by bolstering the immune system; it is not a guarantee that you, personally, will not get ill, and never has been. For example, most childhood **VACC**ines are 90-99% effective in preventing disease, and also tend to be effective in reducing the severity of symptoms. Most of those childhood **VACC**ines have been in use for decades, and have been improved gradually for all of that time. None of them are perfect.

The fact is we knew next to nothing about the virus aside from its outputs: illness, death, exponential infections. If we hadn't proceeded with lockdown: more people would have died. Some form of quarantine action was logic and acceptable in order to buy humanity some time to grapple with the problem.
