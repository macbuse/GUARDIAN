      "71 One effect of NHS funding for gender reassignment is to limit the need for survival sex, if not always eliminating it – my relative ease in accessing this was another spatial privilege for which I was thankful, and made me feel more optimistic about the place of trans people in contemporary Britain.\n",
      "73 If all goes smoothly then, given the waiting lists, I will probably complete the pathway next spring – a total transition time of three years, as I was led to expect when I started by my local PCT's gender reassignment policy.\n",
      "74 I knew at the start that the NHS gender reassignment process would be slow.\n",
      "74 Although I think it right to question if gender reassignment should come under mental health services, I'd be somewhat worried if there were no patient monitoring, partly as I'd have no space to express any concerns, but also because the service would likely be threatened by litigation from people who felt they should have been stopped from realising their own transitional desires.\n",
      "75 The NHS makes this central to their protocol, with gender identity clinics (GICs) demanding at least three months prior to hormone prescription, and two years before sex confirmation surgery.\n",
      "75 Since the early 50s, when Roberta Cowell and Christine Jorgensen hit the headlines, media coverage of gender variance has focused on transsexual people, emphasising (if not sensationalising) the medical aspects of transition.\n",
      "75 The initial local assessment screens for people who are not appropriate for GIC referral – those, perhaps, who may have confused their discomfort with gender expectations for what is often called (perhaps unhelpfully, given the psychiatrists' aim to separate these from a patient's sex) gender dysphoria – that is, a transsexual impulse.\n",

      "75 – do not police gender presentations as rigorously as in the past, aiming instead to explore and manage their patients' expectations of life in their target bodies.\n",
      "75 The transitional pathway still relies heavily on psychiatry, which, for all its advances over the years, is not an exact science, but no other 'cure' had been found for genuine and professionally verified cases of gender dysphoria since its first treatment during the 1930s.\n",
      "76 I wrote when discussing 'passing' that gender roles are like languages, with men expected to 'speak' (or perform) their version of 'masculinity', and women 'femininity'.\n",
      "76 Otherwise, I considered gender presentation primarily when I was told to – this feedback gradually changed the way I dressed and behaved.\n",
      "76 Of course, femininity is not solely about external things – clothes, cosmetics or posture – but by definition, they are the most obvious manifestations of individual attitudes towards gender roles, and getting them conspicuously wrong can have real social consequences.\n",
      "76 Often, these writers (such as that cited above, from the 70s) oscillated between blaming the gender identity clinics and their patients for the way they believed transsexual women to present themselves.\n",
      "76 However, they are long behind the contemporary reality: in the past, certain GICs did make rigorous, rather conservative demands of their patients' gender presentations, but they've gradually moved beyond this.\n",
      "77 Plenty of male-to-female transsexual narratives describe a pre-transitional flight into hyper-masculinity as they tried and failed to repress their gender identities.\n",
      "77 and I realised just how vigilant some teenage boys could be against even the tiniest gender transgressions.\n",
      "77 a pre-transitional moment that made me realise that although playing with my gender presentation might be risky at times, it could also be fun (and funny).\n",
      "77 Getting over that deeply ingrained fear of more aggressive men has taken a while, especially as it's always males who hurl abuse at me in the street – for a short while after beginning transition, I 'femmed down' for football matches, unwilling to stop doing something I loved, but afraid that the gender regulation I still encounter might move from taunts to violence if I dressed too conspicuously in the wrong context.\n",
      "80 The trashy British acts alienated me, with their clichéd caricatures of femininity: my gender issues felt serious, and the mockery these performers invited didn't seem too helpful.\n",
      "81 Doctors cannot legally block access to medical services – since a ruling in 1999, they have been obliged to refer patients elsewhere if they morally oppose gender reassignment.\n",
      "81 \"I've been to the gender clinic at Charing Cross and they said that before I start on hormones, I should talk to someone about saving some sperm.\n",
      "83 However, I worried that striving for a 'feminine' manner of speaking (which would require much more work to achieve and sustain) might lead acquaintances to feel that I was becoming a different person, or that I was conforming to a gender stereotype rather than being the 'real' me (as they saw it, obviously).\n",
      "84 But the reason why her video resonates with so many transsexual people is because of the frequently encountered assumption that by externalising our gender dissonance, we somehow invite any question on any aspect of our lives.\n",
      "84 The idea that I might undertake the gender reassignment process without myself or others questioning my mental health left me speechless (something which people who know me say doesn't happen often).\n",
      "84 Most questions came down to the single word (which drives parents of small children mad): \"Why?\" I could tell people that I had never felt comfortable in a male body, nor with the expectations that came with it, but I couldn't satisfactorily put into words the roots of my gender dysphoria to someone who'd never experienced it.\n",
      "85 Tranny' nights, which felt more suited to those who would not transition (especially transvestites) didn't appeal, even before I came to define as transsexual, and I started to look beyond clubs (which often, on some level, cater for people of shared sexuality rather than gender identity) for community support.\n",
      "85 Through the volunteer-led Clare Project drop-in sessions, I met people who were considering gender reassignment, or who'd finished it, or were partway through the pathway.\n",
      "86 As I explained in my last blog, the World Health Organisation classifies gender dysphoria as a mental illness, and in Britain, transsexuality is treated through mental health services.\n",
      "86 But our complex relationships with our psychologies begin long before we enter the gender reassignment pathway and fret about whether or not the gatekeepers will judge us mentally fit to transition.\n",
      "86 The second I recognised my gender dissonance, I knew my life would become harder.\n",
      "86 In Section 28 era Britain, sexual or gender difference wasn't seriously discussed in the classroom, so I had no outlet – except, maybe, my friends.\n",
      "86 The anxiety remained, seemingly ingrained within my psyche: I'd hoped that coming out as transsexual to friends and family might temper it, but the trials of passing and finding employment, as well as negotiating NHS gender services, meant I merely swapped one set of worries for another.\n",
      "87 This is not always diminished by the experiences posted online by patients, some of whom have reservations about gender services being 'pathologised' under mental health (rather than being treated as an endocrine issue).\n",
      "87 Gender dysphoria is currently classified as a 'mental illness' by the World Health Organisation, despite growing pressure to revise this.\n",
      "87 As for 'Charing Cross', a clinic staffed by clinicians will always feel clinical, and there's a detached, paternalistic streak running through the NHS that reaches far beyond its gender services.\n",
      "87 No questions about how I presented as female, or any comments on my clothing, contradicting the long-standing criticism that Gender Identity Clinics attempt to bludgeon their patients into conforming to conservative gender roles.\n",
      "87 This was about becoming female in body: my gender presentation was my choice alone.\n",
      "87 Also, as their official name suggests, they will monitor any mental health matters related to my gender issues.\n",
      "89 I consulted the HR manager and the equality and diversity manager, who assured me that most employees would be supportive, and that I shouldn't let my plans stop me from trying to secure another position (the days of transsexual people being urged to find a new job before changing their gender presentation are, thankfully, past).\n",
      "92 They don't understand that sexuality and gender identity isn't the same thing: gay men don't want to be women, and lesbians don't want to be men.\n",
      "92 Sexuality exists on a spectrum, as does gender identity - mine just both point away from what you'd expect based on biology at birth.\n",
      "93 The books I read suggested that to pass was to conform to an antiquated binary that suffocated more diverse (and fun) forms of gender expression.\n",
      "93 I decided to draw a line: I'd try to pass on the street, without striving too hard to hide my inter-gender status in situations where people knew and accepted it - at least in the earliest stages of transition.\n",
      "94 I naively presumed that 'gay' would cover any sexual or gender difference in my parents' minds: after a couple of tough conversations, things had carried on as before.\n",
      "94 But I came to think (without any real evidence) that they weren't fully aware of my gender issues, believing that they'd dismissed my sixth-form expression as a phase.\n",

      "96 Transgender' is a useful portmanteau term for a coalition of almost everybody unhappy with rigid unalterable binary gender roles, but rapidly became too vague to be entirely useful.\n",
      "97 To my relief, my scores were low - I'd heard rumours that the people at the Charing Cross Gender Identity Clinic don't like to hear of other psychological difficulties besides gender dysphoria.\n",
      "98 That's why I run workshops to educate people about what it is to be born with gender dysphoria.\n",

      "The Mugler Ball, which took place in Queens, New York last weekend, was probably the most fabulous party you weren’t invited to. A sea of gay and straight scenesters gathered at a ballroom to watch a mix of new and legendary vogue dancers compete on stage. It featured all that one would expect from the drag event of the year: theatre, excitement, drama, scandal and sequinned catsuits galore. But beyond these hallmarks, it revealed that vogue ballroom culture has reached a new level of cultural influence. FKA Twigs, who has been training with the vogue dancing legend Jamel Prodigy, took the stage for a 30-second routine of classic hand illusions before gracefully sliding to the floor into a dramatic dip, which is to voguing what the triple Salchow is to figure skating (ie, very difficult). Later that night, Rihanna got on to the stage to do a little preening of her own. Afterwards, pictures from the ball went viral thanks to the stream of famous guests such as Balmain designer Olivier Rousteing, who gushed, in all caps no less, on Instagram about his “FIRST VOGUEING [sic] BALL”.\n",
      "Voguing, a form of dance that was created on the streets of Harlem by a subculture of young gay men in the 1980s, is most easily recognised for its flamboyant hand movements, twirls and poses based on the runway walks of models, and usually performed to house music and a chorus of men screaming “Werk!” and “Yaaaasss!” But it’s more complex than that. Voguing is an art that’s inextricably linked with ideas of fashion, luxury, and social and economic mobility; its dramatic hand and leg movements are based on elements of classical ballet, jazz and modern dance techniques such as those founded by Martha Graham and Lester Horton (many voguers are professional dancers).\n",
      "Balls are the traditional voguing platform. They are judged competitions with some musical theatre, some fashion week and a bit of X-Factor style battles mixed in, and the Mugler Ball is reflective of a wider flirtation between ballroom culture and the worlds of fashion, art and music, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since the early nineties when Madonna co-opted the movement for her Vogue video and reduced it to a series of MTV hits.\n",
      "The critically adored fashion label Hood by Air, founded by the former vogue dancer Shayne Oliver, frequently incorporates references to voguing in their runway shows, and have had such an impact on the fashion industry that the New York Times recently speculated Oliver may have had an influence on the catwalks of Riccardo Tisci and Alexander Wang. And then there’s the gender fluid rapper Mykki Blanco, a fashion crowd favourite and Hood by Air collaborator, whose decidedly countercultural work is praised by very mainstream outlets such as Entertainment Weekly and Interview magazine; in his video, Wavvy, he dances in glam-rock drag at a black tie ball. Meanwhile, at the end of London fashion week in September, Christopher Kane, Roksanda Illincic, Jonathan Saunders, Hamish Bowles and a long list of other fashion notables joined the performance artist Jonny Woo for his staging of the Miss Hoi Polloi pageant at the Ace hotel. The event was based on the documentary The Queen, which chronicled a series of drag pageants hosted by Flawless Sabrina. And last week, MAC Cosmetics held a party to celebrate the iconic drag performance artist Joey Arias. “There’s a new generation exploring. There are more transsexuals, people are experimenting more,” Arias says.\n",
      "It has been 24 years since the documentary Paris is Burning first put a spotlight on Harlem’s ballroom culture and the gender fluid black and latino young men who frequented it. Their styles were eclectic – elegant transwomen, melodramatic butch queens, rough banjee boys, and a myriad of permutations in between – but they were always well dressed, even going as far as to name their loosely organised crews after iconic fashion brands such as the House of Balenciaga or the House of St Laurent. In ballroom culture, the house you belong to is everything. More than a members’ only club, the house is a chosen “family” and social network; a safe place in a city where life can be difficult for a gay black boy. It was a particularly strong act of devotion to name one’s house after a fashion brand, considering the world of pret-a-porter was rarely accessible to them. But today, it’s the opposite. Fashion, art and music seem to be increasingly influenced by ballroom culture rather than the other way around, and it’s the young men who came up in that scene, long a countercultural fringe movement, who are the new arbiters of taste.\n",
      "But before that happened, ballroom culture went the way of most fashion trends: in and then out. After co-opting it, Madonna turned it into a global phenomenon that climaxed with the release of her documentary, Truth or Dare in 1991. After that, mainstream interest in voguing died down, though musicians and model agencies hired some dancers for behind the scenes roles such as video choreography and catwalk coaching.\n",
      "Rashaad Newsome, the contemporary artist based in New York, is arguably the godfather of the next generation ballroom movement. “I think it has to do with the work called Untitled I put in the 2010 Whitney Biennial,” he says. “Before that I had never seen work in a gallery or institution about ballroom culture.” Untitled featured a dancer demonstrating various styles of voguing on camera. It also cemented Newsome’s position as the connector – the Kevin Bacon, if you will – of all of the scene’s buzziest players. For example, the Untitled dancer was a then-unknown Shayne Oliver.\n",
      "Last summer, Newsome put on his own vogue extravaganza called the King of Arms Ball. He brought together luminaries from the contemporary art and underground ballroom scene to watch dancing competitors, including the popular dancer Alex Mugler, a member of the iconic voguing collective, House of Mugler, the same group that had its own now legendary ball this past weekend. Newsome also works with Jamel Prodigy, the dancer who has been training FKA Twigs since he met her through a choreographer at a club. “He introduced me to this girl from London who really wanted to learn how to vogue. And then when I met her I realised hers was the face I had been seeing on posters all over New York. She wanted to get the authentic New York experience from a ballroom legend.”\n",
      "It all seems to add up to an overall celebration of gender fluidity in fashion and beauty culture, a moment in which people who may have been relegated to the status of camp entertainment in years past are finally being taken seriously. Perhaps the most potent example of this is Redken, the mass-market beauty Behemoth, hiring Lea T, transgender model and countercultural heroine, as its latest face. “Gay is the new black,” as Prodigy puts it. And while the fashion and beauty worlds have always embraced, and to an extent been largely dominated by gay men, they haven’t been particularly open to transgenders. “It’s one of those things where everything that wasn’t, now is. And everything that was a ‘no’ is now a ‘yes’.”\n",
      "It could be argued that fashion’s current celebration of gender nonconformity is a natural step in its slow but gradual shift towards diversity. Or possibly it’s the latest frontier in fashion’s perennial search for the new. Roger Joseph, a luxury brand consultant who is familiar with ballroom culture, thinks it’s a bit of both. “I think that when compared to the increasingly corporate art and fashion worlds, ballroom culture feels more real, inclusive and expansive.” He adds: “I think we’re seeing ballroom culture referenced more now because the fashion industry is beginning to reflect what it sees. If the lovely Laverne Cox, the transwoman star of the Netflix hit Orange is the New Black, can grace the cover of a storied American publication like Time magazine and bring compassion, eloquence and wit to conversations around gender and the trans community, then why wouldn’t designers want to seize its currency?”\n",

      "Clothes used to hold a lot more significance for me than they do now. In 2011, at the beginning of my transition, I definitely felt the need to look feminine for people in order to validate my gender identity. Now I just don’t care. I am as much a woman if I’m in trackie bottoms and an oversized jumper as I am in a long sequin gown – it has no impact on who I am as a person.\n",
      "\n",
      "That’s something it has taken me a long time to learn, but it’s also why the conversations surrounding non-binary identities are so important. It is getting rid of gender stereotypes that ultimately oppress everybody. I think that being complacent and not challenging norms is dangerous, because marginalised people don’t benefit from the norm.\n",
      "\n",
      "This shirt dress is by Art School London – two young designers who also happen to be non-binary – and I wore it at London fashion week menswear earlier this year. I walked for Art School two seasons back and just fell in love with them. I like that they’re making a statement by saying: “What is menswear in 2019?” It could be absolutely anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am a little more dressy than usual at fashion week, but this is a typical “going out” look for me. I don’t like to stick to a single aesthetic and I’m inspired by women who are the same: Beyoncé, Rihanna, even Oprah. Having one set look works for some people but my tastes tend to change, although I gravitate towards clothes that make me feel me empowered. I don’t have any fashion regrets: everything I’ve worn, I’ve wanted to wear at the time. Not everything works but it doesn’t have to – you’re allowed to get it wrong. I just wear whatever I feel excited by.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the beginning of my transition, I was more experimental with my clothes – but even now I’m always up for trying new things. I’ve definitely honed it and know what is flattering for my shape – but, also, my shape has changed. I’m a lot more curvy now and I’ve learned how to embrace that. I guess I’d describe my style as “comfortably glamorous”.\n",
