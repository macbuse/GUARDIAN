'My daughter's partner treats her badly, wants a sex change, and is chatting up my youngest girl'



My eldest daughter, 23, has been living with her 26-year-old boyfriend for four years – the past two at my house. He treats her dreadfully, speaks to her as if she's a servant, has no job, no ambition and two children with a previous partner he never sees. He has already cheated on my daughter twice and has now decided he wants to have a sex change.

I have no problems with transgender people, but I am deeply unhappy at this new turn of events. He and my eldest daughter haven't had sex for ages apparently yet he still tries to chat up my 20-year-old daughter. I cannot throw him out without my daughter going too, and she is too vulnerable. She will not discuss the situation because she says I don't understand their "open" relationship or the fact that she is so loyal to him. Any suggestions?
