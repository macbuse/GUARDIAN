Boy Meets Girl’s Rebecca Root: ‘I love the look of high heels but I find them excruciating’



I figure out what I am wearing a couple of days before a big event, so I know that my clothes are clean, ironed and still fit. I make sure my shoes are polished, and decide on a handbag. My cousin gives me tips. When I went to the LA premiere of The Danish Girl I took her advice to wear black and keep it classy. I wore a black jumpsuit and a fabulous sheer shawl with black sequins. The jumpsuit from Long Tall Sally, which caters for the taller lady – I am 6ft 1in – had a low front and sheer back, so I went braless. I have massive feet – size 10 – so I have a problem with shoes. Crispins, in London, caters for women’s large shoe sizes – not specifically trans. I bought a gorgeous pair of black patent, slightly pointy, low heels. I love the look of high heels but I find them excruciating. I would rather feel elegant in a low heel than tower above everybody.

While I am doing my makeup, I like a glass of champagne or a gin and tonic. I check my hair is OK and make sure I don’t have stray hairs on my face. Whether or not you are trans, there are always going to be one or two. When I was transitioning, I had laser hair removal on my face as well as my chest, underarms, bikini line, arms and fingers. You can’t spend your life shaving your arms.

My makeup is minimal: powder to take down shine, brown eyeshadow, kohl and waterproof mascara. When I was going through my transition I couldn’t stop crying, not least because my body was going through hormonal change. I learned that non-waterproof mascara was not a great look so I have stuck with Maybelline waterproof, even though I don’t cry as often now.
