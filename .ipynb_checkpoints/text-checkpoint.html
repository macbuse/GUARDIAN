<h2 id="1798680612674548872">Young girls being sold in India to repay loans, says human rights body</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Young girls in the northern Indian state of Rajasthan are being sold as “repayment” for loans their parents cannot afford, the national body that protects human rights has said.</p>

<p>The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to the state government demanding a police inquiry and answers within a month to what it called an “abominable” practice.</p>

<p>People living in many rural areas in India often have to borrow money from fellow villagers when a family member falls seriously ill and needs medical treatment.</p>

<p>Local media reports say that in half a dozen districts around Bhilwara, if a family cannot repay a loan, the aggrieved creditor has complained to the “caste panchayats” or caste councils.</p>

<p>By way of “settlement”, the councils have ordered the family to hand over their daughter – sometimes more than one depending on the size of the loan – so that the creditor can sell her to a trafficker to recoup his money.</p>

<p>In its notice, the commission said that if the family refuses to sell their daughter, “their mothers are subjected to rape on the diktats of caste panchayats for the settlement of disputes”.</p>

<p>Among the cases highlighted by the commission is that of a man who borrowed 1.5m rupees (£15,800) from a neighbour who was forced by the panchayat to sell his sister and 12-year-old daughter to settle the debt.</p>

<p>In another, a man who borrowed 600,000 rupees (£6,300) when his wife fell ill and needed hospital treatment was unable to repay it. The panchayat compelled him to hand over his young daughter to the creditor, who later sold her to a trafficker in Agra. From there, “she was sold three times and became pregnant four times”, the commission said.</p>

<p>The commission has sent an official to Rajasthan to investigate the cases. The Bhilwara district collector, Ashish Modi, said the crimes were the first of their kind. “They are total illegal. The police are investigating and we will make sure the victims get justice and the guilty are punished,” Modi said.</p>

<p>Panchayats are often a profoundly regressive force in rural India, acting as kangaroo courts. They have ordered so-called honour killings of couples who have defied tradition by marrying into a different caste or faith or ordered brutal punishments for couples suspected of adultery.</p>

<p>Kavita Srivastava, a veteran women’s rights activist in Jaipur, Rajasthan, said it was well known that caste panchayats informally regulated villagers’ personal matters such as marriage, inheritance or custody. If people defy their orders, they are ostracised and shunned by the rest of the community.</p>

<p>“But what is new in these cases is that they seem to have expanded their ambit to settle loan disputes in this way,” Srivastava said.</p>


<h2 id="1018192890249412849">Iran: deaths reported as security forces open fire on protesters in Zahedan</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Iranian security forces have opened fired on protesters in Zahedan a month after a massacre that killed scores of people in the restive south-eastern city.</p>

<p>Crowds were also fired on in Mahabad, another city with a long history of resistance against the regime, in renewed deadly violence at the end of the sixth week of unrest sparked by the death in police custody of Mahsa Amini on 16 September.</p>

<p>There were reports of as many as six killed in Zahedan on Friday, including a 12-year-old boy. In a desperate attempt calm local anger, at midnight on Thursday the provincial authorities had suddenly sacked the chief of Zahedan police and a second senior officer due to “deficiencies” in their handling of protests in the city on 30 September.</p>

<p>In a highly unusual admission of fault on the part of Iran’s security apparatus, the provincial authorities admitted that police had been responsible for the death of as many as 35 people on 30 September, including some innocent people leaving prayers.</p>

<p>Zahedan is the capital of Sistan-Baluchistan province, one of Iran’s poorest, and the provincial security council promised to provide compensation to the injured and their families. The 30 September protest had been called in response to the reported rape of a teenage girl by a police commander, and some rights groups have put the death toll on the day – which has come to be known as Bloody Friday among Iranians – at above 90.</p>

<p>The midnight admission had clearly been intended to avert trouble at Friday prayers after repeated accusations by Maulvi Abdul Hamid, a leading Sunni cleric based in Zahedan, that the supreme leader of the majority Shia country – Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – had failed to punish the security forces for the killings.</p>

<p>Tribal elders had gathered on Thursday night at the mosque at which the cleric speaks to show their support for him, after he came under attack from clerics loyal to the government.</p>

<p>Fearing trouble, the security services sent reinforcements to the city before Friday, but huge crowds attended prayers at the Makki mosque and dozens then took to the streets, according to activists.</p>

<p>The scale of the subsequent violence is disputed by official news agencies, who blamed “rioters” for the unrest. Zahedan is one of the few Sunni-majority cities in predominantly Shia Iran, and there will be concern in Iran and beyond if ethnic and religious tensions come to the surface alongside the calls for greater women’s rights.</p>

<p>Videos widely shared online showed people rallying on Friday across Iran, including in Mahabad, the flashpoint western city where a rights group said security forces had killed at least four people in the past two days.</p>

<p>The Norway-based Hengaw organisation, which reports on human rights violations in Iranian Kurdistan, said that two more people were killed on Thursday in Baneh, another city near Iran’s western border with Iraq.</p>

<p>And Amnesty International said late on Thursday that “unlawful killings” by the security forces had claimed least eight lives in four provinces within 24 hours.</p>

<p>In Mahabad, Thursday night’s bloodshed came as mourners paying tribute to Ismail Mauludi, a 35-year-old protester killed the previous night, made their way from his funeral towards the governor’s office. “Death to the dictator,” protesters yelled, using a slogan aimed at the supreme leader, as the governor’s office burned.</p>

<p>Funerals for protesters have become flashpoints in the weeks-long unrest that has gripped the clerical state, and on Friday the UN human rights office said it was concerned that authorities were refusing to release some of the bodies of those killed.</p>

<p>“We’ve seen a lot of ill treatment … but also harassment of the families of protesters,” Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson of the office of the high commissioner for human rights, told a Geneva press briefing. “Of particular concern is information that authorities have been moving injured protesters from hospitals to detention facilities and refusing to release the bodies of those killed to their families.”</p>

<p>Shamdasani added that in some cases, authorities were placing conditions on the release of bodies, asking families not to hold a funeral or speak to the media.</p>

<p>In a related incident, the family of the well-known journalist Reza Haghighatnejad have accused security agents of “abducting” his body after his death in Germany, in order to prevent his funeral taking place. Haghighatnejad, 45, a former editor at IranWire and eloquent exiled critic of the regime, died from cancer in Berlin on 17 October. His body was repatriated to Iran for burial on 25 October.</p>

<p>In comments made on video, his mother said: “I have not seen my son in six years. They let me bring his body to Iran, but Sepah (the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps) or police abducted his body at the airport.”</p>

<p>Haghighatnejad’s sister Sara said she had been unable to find any information on his body.</p>

<p>RFE/RL, where he worked from 2019 until his death, quoted relatives and friends as saying the necessary permits had been issued to bury the body in Haghighatnejad’s home town of Shiraz. But the security and intelligence agencies were putting pressure on the family to agree to his body being buried in another cemetery outside the city.</p>

<p>The RFE/RL president and CEO, Jamie Fly, said the Iranian regime’s manipulation of Haghighatnejad’s family was “disgraceful and disgusting”, and that they deserved to be allowed to bury him without harassment.</p>


<h2 id="2174576815926626750">What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Daniel Boffey travelled to Kherson, where Russia’s grip appeared increasingly fragile after a weekend in which all civilians were ordered to leave immediately in the face of the advancing Ukrainian counteroffensive.</p>

<p>Kherson city was taken in the very early days of the war and remains the only regional capital to fall to Russia since 24 February. The residents of Kherson and the region have suffered enormous losses: in March, Russian soldiers swept into the farming village of Dudchany, setting up bases in abandoned homes and municipal buildings. There was constant heavy shelling, and the sound of low-flying planes would fill villagers, hiding in bunkers, with fear. The story of Dudchany is that of the brutal reality of a community that has found itself with a war on its doorstep, Boffey writes.</p>

<p>“As she was driven by her son out of Dudchany … Rosaliya Kovalchuk, 72, glimpsed something from the backseat that will haunt her forever.”</p>

<p>“‘Hanging from the branches of a tree were guts from a man’s belly,’ Kovalchuk said, pausing as she sought to collect her emotions. ‘A military car had been blown up. I think he was Russian from the boots and the uniform.’”</p>

<p>Ukrainians living in and around Kyiv have been told of a “sharp deterioration” in the region’s electricity supply after a fresh wave of Russian strikes aimed at sapping public morale as the country’s cold winter approaches, Dan Sabbagh reported.</p>

<p>A local energy supplier, Yasno, warned that existing blackouts could last a lot longer than a previously planned schedule of four-hour outages and that the capital already faced an electricity deficit of about 30% or more.</p>

<p>Oleksiy Kuleba, the governor of the Kyiv region, said the area, including the capital city, was a victim of Russian attacks on Ukraine’s national grid. “A number of critical facilities have been disabled,” he added.</p>

<p>Russia has brought Ukraine’s electricity system to crisis point in little over a fortnight, by switching the focus of its missile and drone attacks to power stations and the distribution grid.</p>

<p>The Guardian’s foreign affairs commentator, Simon Tisdall, wrote about the Storskog border crossing in Finnmark, where Arctic Norway comes face to face with the cold reality of Russia.</p>

<p>“Reasons to worry afresh about the border are multiplying following Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Norwegian police recently arrested several Russians, equipped with drones and cameras, who were showing unusual interest in oil and gas installations. Some of the suspected spies entered via Storskog.</p>

<p>“Since Russia cut energy supplies to Europe in retaliation for western sanctions – and following last month’s sabotage of the Nord Stream Baltic pipelines – Norway has become Europe’s biggest gas supplier. And while the Oslo government is not directly accusing Moscow, it knows that makes it a prime target for covert hybrid warfare operations.”</p>

<p>After Russia accused Ukraine of planning to use a dirty bomb on its own soil and then blame it on Russia, a claim it took to the UN security council, Peter Beaumont and Andrew Roth explained just what a dirty bomb is, and what Russia is up to: in the first instance, Putin’s aim appears to be to get the west talking about how a dirty bomb could be used and what that would mean, much in the same way that Moscow’s hints about using a tactical nuclear weapon in Ukraine dominated the news agenda, they explain.</p>

<p>Later in the week, Putin said that the claims were made on his direct orders. In a speech near Moscow, Putin claimed once again that Russia knew “about an incident with a so-called ‘dirty bomb’ being prepared”, and that Russia knew “where, generally, it was being prepared”.</p>

<p>Once again he gave no evidence of the alleged plot, which included the possibility of the device being loaded on to a Tochka-U or other tactical missile, detonated and then “blamed on Russia”.</p>

<p>Kyiv has strongly denied the accusations and said that Russia is using nuclear blackmail in order to try to block support for its successful counteroffensive against the Russian invasion force.</p>

<p>After Volodymyr Zelenskiy last week announced a prisoner swap between 108 Ukrainian women and 110 Russians – the first all female prisoner swap of the war – Daniel Boffey tracked Alina Panina who was one of those freed in the exchange.</p>

<p>After five months in the most notorious jail in occupied Ukraine, she found herself, without explanation, at the foot of a bridge over a river in no man’s land with 107 fellow female Ukrainian prisoners of war. “We were told nothing,” she said. But then the order came to cross.</p>

<p>Panina, a junior sergeant in the national border guard, described the experience of counting off the hours and endless days with 28 other women in a cell designed for four.Nights could be difficult.</p>

<p>“Because of where we had been people would wake up screaming. It was difficult to sleep because the slightest noise would alarm people. But we became like sisters. We would spend our time talking about recipes, braiding each other’s hair. I read. The Russians gave us some books all about their history.”</p>

<p>Dan Sabbagh interviewed Oleksandra Matviichuk, the Ukrainian lawyer who heads the Centre for Civil Liberties which this month jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize. The body she heads has patiently documented more than 21,000 examples of war crimes committed by occupying Russian forces since 2014, including many from after the invasion in February.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any legal instrument to stop the Russian atrocities.” She told Sabbagh she has no immediate way of bringing perpetrators to court.</p>

<p>“After the large-scale invasion, we every day documented different kinds of war crimes, like intentional shelling of residential buildings, churches, hospitals, schools, the shelling of evacuation corridors,” Matviichuk said. “We received requests for help from people in the occupied territories because they were abducted, tortured; we recorded sexual violence, extrajudicial killings.”</p>

<p>Staff from the Centre for Civil Liberties were among those who travelled through Irpin, Bucha and towns and villages north-west of Kyiv after Russia abandoned its attempt to seize the city in March. “I will remind you,” she says, that bodies were found lying uncollected in the streets, or dumped in mass graves. “And what was Putin’s response? He provided medals to the army unit that was staying in Bucha.”</p>

<p>Bosnian Poet Faruk Šehić wrote in an opinion piece that if you “stop a person on the street in Sarajevo and ask them what they think about the war in Ukraine, they’ll tell you they think that almost everything that happened in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina is happening in Ukraine.</p>

<p>“In April, we commemorated the 30th anniversary of the war against Bosnia-Herzegovina. We consider early April 1992 the moment a new era began: we have the before, during and after the catastrophe.</p>

<p>“A month into the war in Ukraine I saw Ukrainians starting to use the phrase “before the war”. We went through everything that’s happening to them, but no one asks us about it or wants us to help.”</p>


<h2 id="1482312605734938647">Was Hu Jintao’s removal from China’s 20th party congress suspicious or not?</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>After eight days of China’s most important political meeting, in which the autocratic leader Xi Jinping’s precedent-breaking third term was confirmed, belligerent foreign policy reaffirmed, and the leader of the world’s largest population and second-largest economy announced through the next five years, one question was on everyone’s lips: what on earth happened to Hu Jintao and where is he now?</p>

<p>The drama happened on Saturday morning. In a short window between foreign media being allowed into Beijing’s Great Hall and the start of the final public meeting of the 20th party congress, the former Chinese leader Hu was physically removed from his seat next to his successor, Xi, and out of the Great Hall of the People.</p>

<p>It was a shocking scene from the Chinese Communist party’s notoriously opaque political environment and an event so controlled that even the refilling of teacups was choreographed. It sparked immediate and occasionally wild guesswork, which continued throughout the week.</p>

<p>Devoid of explanation, the imagery easily lent itself to the narrative of Xi’s extraordinary power consolidation, the deck-clearing of potential adversaries, and his abandonment of his predecessors’ vision for the CCP.</p>

<p>“Some people are surprised by the abnormality that is Hu’s disorderly exit, at what should normally be a very highly choreographed and orderly event,” said Sung Wen-ti, a political scientist at Australia National University’s Centre on China in the World. “That abnormality fuels speculations.”</p>

<p>Hu had attended congress as a member of the Presidium, a committee of party elders that oversees key congress processes and events.</p>

<p>According to available footage, Hu was escorted into the Great Hall on Saturday morning by a staff member and took his seat to the left of Xi. Shortly after foreign media were allowed to enter the hall, Hu looked at some papers in front of him on the table. An outgoing politburo member Li Zhanshu, to his left, appeared to try to stop him by taking the paper and returning it to a red folder, pushing it out of Hu’s reach. Xi appeared to call over a clerk and two staff took him away, gently lifting him out of his seat by his armpits. One picked up the folder and as the papers briefly flapped open, a photo by Spanish media reportedly showed it to be documents relating to the day’s proceedings, including the changes to the Politburo.</p>

<p>Throughout, Hu appeared confused and unwilling, made a short unreadable comment to Xi, and patted China’s outgoing premier, Li Keqiang, on the shoulder as he exited.</p>

<p>Hu has not been seen in public since, although his son Hu Haifeng, a rising party official who was in the audience of 2,300 delegates, has appeared at formal events this week.</p>

<p>Global audiences have been told it was health-related. Xinhua News, the official state media, said on Twitter – which is banned in China – that Hu had been ill recently and was taken out of the room by concerned staff so he could rest. China’s ambassador to Korea said media reports had been “completely skewed”, and the elderly Hu “had to step outside for a break”.</p>

<p>Domestically, no one has been told anything. There were no results about it on Baidu, Bilibili, WeChat or Weibo. No state media reported on it. No recent posts about Hu or his son can be found on Weibo, although some video and comments were visible on Douyin – China’s domestic version of TikTok. Some users accepted the health explanation (“the foreign media are misinterpreting it,” said one). Others were suspicious (“If he feels unwell, others would take care of him, but seeing that he was stopped twice trying to open the red folder – this is so dark,” said another).</p>

<p>The incident has divided China watchers, with some convinced they witnessed a political purging, or at least a deliberate public humiliation, of the former president and leader of Xi’s rival Communist Youth League faction. Foreign Policy’s editor, James Palmer, noted that many of Hu’s former allies have gone this way. Bill Bishop, a China expert and author of the Sinocism newsletter, said if Hu had truly been purged from the CCP it would be odd for state television to then include Hu in news footage of the event – which they did.</p>

<p>Others say the explanations of innocuous health issues offered by state media were more likely. Hu is 79 years old and has been in visibly frail health for some time.</p>

<p>Jeremy Goldkorn, editor-in-chief of the China Project, a New York-based news website, thought the most likely explanation was health issues. “The one thing that some Chinese commentators have pointed out that we can be certain of is that these senior leaders, many of whom owed their careers to Hu, were unable to muster any humanity, warmth, or politeness to show Hu any respect or consideration of any kind,” Goldkorn said.</p>

<p>For some, the footage of Hu trying to read the documents – which wasn’t made public until some days after the event – suggested the factional leader might have been protesting, or about to protest, against the expunging of his last few proteges from the party’s senior ranks and was hustled out to avoid a scene.</p>

<p>“If you’ve watched the CNA video showing the minutes before [he was escorted out], I think the ‘confused and unwell guy’ explanation still makes the most sense,” Kaiser Kuo, host of the Sinica Podcast, said on Twitter. “The whole folder-fumbling. Like the kid who turns his SAT test over before start is announced.”</p>

<p>Sung told the Guardian he doesn’t think that would be Xi’s style. “Even if we entertain the notion that Xi purged Hu because Hu wanted to raise objections in public, Xi would have done that before foreign press were allowed into the room,” he said.</p>

<p>“A high-profile purge of Hu at a critical juncture like the 20th party congress shows the presence of dissent, and the notion that Xi is at least ‘challengeable’. Neither is great for Xi’s image of invincibility.”</p>

<p>Sung said Hu Haifeng’s visibility also pushed against the purge theory. “When [the CCP] purge someone they tend to purge the whole family, at least those family members who are in politics.”</p>

<p>As speculation continues, analysts said we are unlikely to get an official explanation, perhaps at best a very public and government-approved appearance some time soon. “Overexplaining shows weakness,” said Sung. “They will let the next public appearance by Hu do the talking.”</p>

<p>In an analysis piece this week, Rory Truex wrote in the Atlantic that one’s interpretation depended in part on one’s opinion of China’s political system. “Unfortunately, the speculation and rumour-mongering about Hu are a product of the secrecy of the party itself,” he said.</p>


<h2 id="367017466556056146">Three sentenced for ‘enslaving’ man they lured from Latvia to UK</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Two men have been jailed and a woman given a suspended sentence for “enslaving a man to line their own pockets”.</p>

<p>Normunds Freibergs, 40, and his accomplices Jacobus Stankevicius, 59, and Ruta Stankeviciene, 57, exploited and abused the vulnerable victim, whom they forced to work to pay off debt they claimed he owed them.</p>

<p>The man, 31, was lured to the UK from Latvia by Freibergs, who offered him work and then stripped him of his bank card and denied him showers and clean clothes.</p>

<p>Over an 11-month period they made him work in factories then took his wages, stealing from him an estimated £10,000 while the most he received was £20.</p>

<p>As the three were sentenced in Cardiff on Friday, the victim told the court he would “never forget” what had happened to him.</p>

<p>The man said he had wanted to come to the UK for a better life and higher wages, so he could send money home to Latvia to help his struggling family and ill father.</p>

<p>He connected with Freibergs on the Latvian social networking site Draugiem. Freibergs boasted of helping people find jobs in the UK and told him he would have work in a bakery for £8.20 an hour and living costs of £85 a week.</p>

<p>The man sent Freibergs between €600 (£515) and €800 after he said a deposit was needed to get him settled into accommodation.</p>

<p>But when the man arrived in the UK he was forced to live with Stankevicius and Stankeviciene in Newport. The defendants took his passport and threatened him with violence if he tried to leave, claiming he had an ever-increasing “debt” to repay.</p>

<p>The couple ridiculed and mocked him for smelling but prevented him from washing. Stankevicius kept a list on the fridge detailing the victim’s debt, which continued to grow and half of which was made up of interest. One charge was for renting space in a fridge he was not allowed to use.</p>

<p>He was warned that “bad people” in his homeland would force his family to pay if he did not.</p>

<p>The victim began working at a poultry factory shortly before Christmas in 2017, making as much as £500 a week. However, his wages were paid into bank accounts Freibergs had forced him to open and to which only the three defendants had access.</p>

<p>During the trial at Newport crown court the jury heard how the victim’s co-workers at Avara Foods in Abergavenny noticed how little food he had and that he was wearing the same clothes every day.</p>

<p>Colleagues held a collection for him to buy trainers after he turned up for work in the winter wearing sandals, and some said they regularly had shared their food with him.</p>

<p>In October 2018 he went with a colleague to the company’s human resources department and said he was “ready to talk”.</p>

<p>Investigators from the Gangmasters and Labour Abuse Authority arrested the three defendants during an operation with Gwent police in October 2018.</p>

<p>A jury unanimously found them guilty of the charges after the trial at Newport crown court in August.</p>

<p>A statement written by the victim and read aloud by prosecutor Lowri Wynn Morgan said: “When I came to the UK in 2017, it was to secure a better life for myself and my family back in Latvia.</p>

<p>“I believed I’d be able to find better accommodation and better living standards, more job opportunities and better pay and conditions than I experienced working elsewhere in Europe.</p>

<p>“I haven’t forgotten what they did to me. I’m too scared to come to Wales, they have many friends and I believe they will hurt me. The impact of their actions caused me not to trust people now as they will seek to take advantage of me.”</p>

<p>He said that while he now had freedom and had enrolled in college and was taking English lessons, he would “never forget the bad times and what happened to me”.</p>

<p>Laura Thomas, a GLAA investigating officer, said: “The victim was subjected to a life of misery by Freibergs, Stankevicius and Stankeviciene, who ruthlessly exploited and enslaved him, purely to line their own pockets.”</p>

<p>DS Simon Thomas, of Gwent police’s modern-day slavery team, said the force was pleased with the result, adding: “It takes a lot of courage to come forward as a victim of such a heinous and vindictive crime.”</p>

<p>Andrew Brodie, a director at Avara Foods, said: “We are delighted that we have been able to play a part in identifying this hideous crime, bringing the perpetrators to justice and providing meaningful support to the victim.”</p>

<p>Freibergs, of Morley Close, Newport, was jailed for five years for forced or compulsory labour and human trafficking offences. He was cleared of acting as an unlicensed gangmaster.</p>

<p>Stankevicius and Stankeviciene, both of Capel Close, Newport, were convicted of forced or compulsory labour offences.</p>

<p>Stankevicius was jailed for four years, while Stankeviciene avoided immediate custody and received a 20-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months.</p>


<h2 id="1108621095312829312">Paul Pelosi, husband of Nancy Pelosi, in hospital after being attacked at home</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Paul Pelosi, the husband of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, was taken to hospital early on Friday after he was attacked at the couple’s home in California with a hammer by an assailant who was reported to have shouted “Where is Nancy, where is Nancy?”</p>

<p>San Francisco police said that they were called to the Pelosi house in the city on a “wellbeing check” at about 2.27am local time on Friday morning. They found an adult male confronting Paul Pelosi, and a hammer was being grasped by both men.</p>

<p>“The suspect pulled the hammer away from Mr Pelosi and violently assaulted him with it. Our officers immediately tackled the suspect, disarmed him, took him into custody,” said Bill Scott, chief of the San Francisco police department.</p>

<p>Scott named the suspect as David DePape, 42, adding that any motive was still being determined. Charges are to be brought at the San Francisco county jail, including attempted homicide, assault with a deadly weapon, elder abuse, burglary and other felonies.</p>

<p>It was reported by CNN that the suspect intended to tie the victim up “until Nancy got home” and that he had posted rightwing and conspiracy theories online, including content promoting the lie that Donald Trump was deprived of victory in the 2020 election because of voter fraud.</p>

<p>According to the Associated Press, the attacker had specifically targeted the Pelosi family home. Video footage of the house showed glass shattered in a side entrance, indicating where the break-in may have occurred.</p>

<p>A person briefed on the situation told AP that the intruder had confronted Paul Pelosi while demanding to know where his wife was. A similar chant of “Where’s Nancy?” was made by insurrectionists during the assault on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021.</p>

<p>The speaker was not at home at the time of the attack, but was in Washington DC with security protection that accompanies her at all times as standard.</p>

<p>Her husband suffered blunt force trauma to the head and body in the attack. He was being treated in hospital for bruising, severe swelling and other injuries.</p>

<p>In a statement, Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hammill said the speaker’s husband, 82, was “receiving excellent medical care and is expected to make a full recovery”.</p>

<p>“The speaker and her family are grateful to the first responders and medical professionals involved, and request privacy at this time,” Hammill said.</p>

<p>While the exact motivation for the attack was unclear on Friday morning, it raised fears about the safety of members of Congress and their families.</p>

<p>Concerns have been rising, particularly since the insurrection at the US Capitol on 6 January 2021, by extremist supporters of Donald Trump intent on overturning his supposed loss to Joe Biden in the presidential election, about a new era of violent threats against US lawmakers and their families and staff, and their security.</p>

<p>In July, members of Congress were given $10,000 each to upgrade security at their homes in the face of rising threats. Some have pushed for even more protection, pointing to people turning up at their homes and an increasing amount of threatening communications.</p>

<p>Joe Biden called Nancy Pelosi about the incident on Friday morning.</p>

<p>“The president is praying for Paul Pelosi and for Speaker Pelosi’s whole family. This morning he called Speaker Pelosi to express his support after this horrible attack. He is also very glad that a full recovery is expected,” the White House said in a statement.</p>

<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader in the US Senate, called Friday’s attack “a dastardly act”. He said he had conveyed his “deepest concern and heartfelt wishes” to Nancy Pelosi.</p>

<p>Top Republicans also expressed their horror at the attack. Kevin McCarthy, the minority leader in the House who is poised to take over as speaker should the Democrats lose control of the chamber in next month’s midterm elections, reached out to “check in on Paul” according to a spokesperson.</p>

<p>The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, said he was “horrified and disgusted” by the assault.</p>

<p>Paul Pelosi is a businessman who runs his own real estate and venture capital investment firm, Financial Leasing Services, based in San Francisco. He met Nancy D’Alesandro when they were both students in Washington DC, and they married in 1963. They have five children and many grandchildren.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi has had two stints as speaker of the US House, between 2007 to 2011 and since January 2019. She represents California’s 12th congressional district.</p>

<p>A police statement released on Friday confirmed that Nancy Pelosi was in the capital with her security detail at the time of the overnight break-in. The investigation is being handled jointly by the FBI, the US Capitol police (USCP) and local San Francisco officers.</p>

<p>The statement said that special agents with the USCP’s California field office “quickly arrived on scene”. A team of threat assessment investigators from the east coast was also sent to assist the FBI and the San Francisco police department with a joint investigation.</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi had just returned to Washington this week from a security conference in Europe and is due to make a keynote speech at an advocacy event on Saturday evening with vice-president, Kamala Harris.</p>

<p>In addition to the rising threats on members of Congress, state and local politicians have also been confronted by increased threat levels. This week the campaign office of Katie Hobbs, Arizona’s secretary of state who is running for governor of the state in next month’s midterm elections, was broken into.</p>

<p>A suspect, Daniel Mota Dos Reis, has been charged with third-degree burglary.</p>

<p>Often at Pelosi’s side during formal events in Washington, Paul Pelosi largely remains on the west coast.</p>


<h2 id="486733505648563706">‘We need to push’: hair discrimination fight moves to UK workplaces</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Zina Alfa vividly remembers her own experiences of hair discrimination as a child. “A teacher basically said my hair was disgusting, and that it wasn’t school policy and that I needed to take it out immediately,” recalls the 30-year-old entrepreneur and campaigner on the issue, which has been in the spotlight since a series of high-profile legal cases regarding hair discrimination.</p>

<p>She was “ecstatic” then on hearing of the publication on Thursday of landmark guidance by Britain’s equalities watchdog that pupils should not be stopped from wearing their hair in natural afro styles at school.</p>

<p>But for Alfa – whose experience prompted her to launch a hair discrimination toolkit and work with one of the UK’s biggest employers, Unilever, to counter this form of racism – progress can’t just stop at the classroom.</p>

<p>“It’s just the first hurdle of many for making things a bit more equal, so I’m really proud and happy that the new guidance has come out. But now I think we need to push this a bit further, and make sure that this [guidance] is included in the workplace,” she adds.</p>

<p>As a 12-year-old student from south London attending a predominantly white private school, Alfa found her experiences with hair discrimination at school had an impact on her perception of her hair into her adult life.</p>

<p>“My experience with my hair was really quite traumatic, and I developed a sense of self-hate towards my afro hair and I didn’t want to have my hair in braids until I was 25.”</p>

<p>Her experience was just one of many instances of hair discrimination faced by young people, predominately from an African-Caribbean background at school.</p>

<p>The most notable instances have resulted in legal battles, including the experiences of Ruby Williams while a 15-year-old at her school in east London, as well as those of Chikayzea Flanders while a 12-year-old at his secondary school in south London.</p>

<p>The new guidance, informed by the observation of the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) that hair discrimination disproportionately affects people with afro hair or protective styles, also states that school uniform policies that ban certain hairstyles, without the possibility for exceptions to be made on racial grounds, are likely to be unlawful.</p>

<p>Although the guidance is limited at hair discrimination taking place in schools, there have also been calls for the publication to be extended to the workplace and other public settings.</p>

<p>Danson Njoka, a 36-year-old performer, says he experienced instances of hair discrimination in his current role and also within his former workplace, working in corporate finance, where his hair was described as “wild” by colleagues.</p>

<p>“I started growing my hair out just before I left the [corporate] world,” Njoka says. “The reason why I left is because after speaking to my grandmother about haircare practices in Kenya, it really got me thinking about why we were told we had to cut off our hair for it to be seen as professional.”</p>

<p>Now working as a performer, Njoka says that the most recent instance of hair discrimination he faced was while auditioning for a role for a Netflix show.</p>

<p>“The show has reached out specifically to a group of people-of-colour performers, because they wanted more diversity on the show,” he says.</p>

<p>Njoka says that after sending in his picture, the agent came back saying the production has asked if he could cut his dreadlocks.</p>

<p>“I replied to them that it was wrong, and that they should have initially asked for people with short hair if that was what they wanted,” Njoka says. “It was offensive and it was saddening. To have to change my body in order to get a job, I don’t think that’s a barrier that white people encounter as much.”</p>

<p>Although there have been calls for the EHRC’s guidance to be extended beyond schools, its publication has been greatly welcomed by Ruby Williams, whose family won a legal battle against her former school after her natural afro hair was deemed inappropriate for the classroom.</p>

<p>“The EHRC helped me so much with my case. Without their support and funding I would’ve had to give up on fighting the policy at my school,” Williams says. “I am very relieved to know that this detailed guidance exists now. I still can’t believe what happened to me, but worse, I can’t believe some schools still think it is reasonable to police afro hair – a huge part of our racial identity.</p>

<p>“I urge all schools to review their policies urgently, involving pupils and families in that process. I hope that this will prevent other children from experiencing what I did.”</p>


<h2 id="1341086654415230057">Russia-Ukraine war live: Russia has fired 4,500 missiles on Ukraine since invasion, says Zelenskiy; more than 300 drones ‘shot down’ – as it happened</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The time in Kyiv is 9pm. Here is a round-up of the day’s headlines:
• None President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claims Russia has launched 8,000 air strikes and fired 4,500 missiles throughout the war. He vows the attacks will not break Ukraine’s spirits as “to hear the enemy’s anthem on our land is scarier than the enemy’s rockets in our sky”.
• None At least four people have been killed and 10 wounded in the latest attack from Russian troops, Ukraine has said. Several towns neighbouring the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia power plant across the Dnieper River were hit by shelling, a statement from the presidential office said.
• None Ukraine has shot down more than 300 Iranian Shahed-136 ‘kamikaze’ drones so far, an air force spokesperson, Yuriy Ihnat, told a briefing on Friday. The drones have become a key weapon in Russia’s arsenal during its war in Ukraine and have often been used in the past month to target crucial energy infrastructure.
• None Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, has said that the “partial mobilisation” Russia announced in September was complete. Speaking at a meeting with president, Vladimir Putin, broadcast on state television, Shoigu said that 82,000 mobilised recruits were in the conflict zone, with a further 218,000 in training.
• None The United States will provide $275 million in additional military assistance to Ukraine, including arms, munitions and equipment from US Department of Defense inventories, secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said. “We are also working to provide Ukraine with the air defense capabilities it needs with the two initial US-provided Nasams ready for delivery to Ukraine next month and we are working with allies and partners to enable delivery of their own air defense systems to Ukraine,” Blinken said.
• None Assets belonging to Russian and Belarusian individuals seized by Ukraine could be used for the country’s massive post-war reconstruction effort, finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, was quoted as saying. The government has frozen Russian and Belarusian assets in Ukraine worth some 44 billion hryvnias ($1.21 bn) since the start of Moscow’s invasion, according to the Economic Security Bureau, a state agency.
• None The US and its allies condemned Russia for wasting the time of the UN security council and spreading conspiracies by again raising its accusation that the US has ‘military biological programmes’ in Ukraine. “How much more of this nonsense do we have to endure?” the UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, asked the council.
• None Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he had received a phone call from his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian on Friday and that he had demanded Tehran stop sending weapons to Russia. Ukraine and its western allies have accused Iran of sending ‘kamikaze’ drones to Russia which have then been used to devastating effect by Russian forces in strikes targeting Ukrainian infrastructure. Iran denies the charge.
• None Russia has bolstered its troops with “mobilised reservists” west of the Dnieper River, the UK’s MoD says. Over the past six weeks, its ground forces have transitioned to a “defensive posture” on the frontline, likely due to being “severely undermanned” and “poorly trained”.
• None The EU appoints Polish general Piotr Trytek to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops. Trytek, 51, was chosen by the bloc as part of its pledge to step up military support for Ukraine.
• None A Russian official’s threat to “strike” western satellites aiding Ukraine has raised concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit. No country has carried out a missile strike against an enemy’s satellite.
• None The UN nuclear inspectors are expected to reach conclusion on “dirty bomb”. Investigators are being sent to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged the activities were taking place, and are expected to reach a conclusion “in days very fast”.</p>


<h2 id="1067652885577502835">Perpetrator of Syria’s Tadamon massacre still working on military base</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The Syrian intelligence officer at the centre of one of the most shocking acts of the civil war – the Tadamon massacre – is still working on a military base outside Damascus and has since been accused by colleagues of directing up to a dozen more mass killings.</p>

<p>Amjad Yousef, a major in one of Syria’s most feared intelligence units, is operating from the Kafr Sousa base, where he has been for most of the past six months since the Guardian revealed his role in shooting dead dozens of people across a death pit in Tadamon, a suburb of the Syrian capital in 2013.</p>

<p>A former colleague of Yousef’s said he had admitted to the killings in a phone call with a mutual friend. “He said ‘Yes I did it. That is what I had to do at the time.’ No one was shocked we knew him. And we know the regime,” the former colleague told the Guardian.</p>

<p>The images shocked the Syrian diaspora and drew condemnation across Europe and in Washington. France, Germany and the Netherlands have all opened war crimes investigations using laws of universal jurisdiction and are hunting any perpetrators who may have escaped to European soil.</p>

<p>German investigators believe they may have identified an associate of Yousef’s now living in Germany and are preparing a case against the former intelligence officer. The Tadamon revelations also caused uproar in Syria, rattling the country’s leadership, which usually keeps a vice-like grip on state secrets, and causing widespread anger even among supporters of the president, Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>After the revelations, close to 100 long-term prisoners were released from government dungeons. Some had been locked up for more than a decade.</p>

<p>The former colleague of Yousef’s told the Guardian that the major had been a feared presence in Tadamon for the past decade, and had regularly snatched women from the streets of the suburb, many of whom were never seen again. “I saw him take women from a bread queue one morning. They were innocent. They had done nothing. They were either raped, or killed. Nothing less.”</p>

<p>Yousef was identified through research conducted by Prof Uğur Üngör and the researcher Annsar Shahoud from the University of Amsterdam’s Institute of Holocaust and Genocide Studies. The academics were leaked 27 videos, which were downloaded from the laptop used by Branch 227 of the Syrian intelligence, – of which Yousef was deputy leader. The sources who leaked the videos fled Syria earlier this year and their identities are being sought by the country’s military intelligence, which has opened an inquiry into how the material was leaked.</p>

<p>In an unpublished video, seen by the Guardian, Yousef shoots up to six women across a pit as his death quad looks on, and sometimes joins the slaughter. The pit is then set alight and a bulldozer brings ash and debris to fill it in, in what appears to be an attempt to eliminate evidence of the war crime.</p>

<p>The former colleague said up to a dozen more massacres were carried out in Tadamon and that local people were well aware of the locations. “All of the people were Sunnis,” he said. “This was sectarian cleansing. Nothing else. It was Alawites eliminating Sunnis.”</p>

<p>A sectarian dimension to the killings had been suspected, but two more of Yousef’s former colleagues had suggested they were also intended as a warning to communities in or near Tadamon not to collaborate with opposition groups.</p>

<p>The source said all massacre sites in Tadamon were no-go zones for local residentsand that the final death toll of killings by Branch 227 could be as high as 350.</p>

<p>The videos marked one of the only examples in the Syrian war where senior regime officials were shown committing atrocities. The unit recorded the videos to demonstrate to senior leaders – and even Syria’s political regime – what had taken place.</p>

<p>Assad reacted angrily when France announced in August that it would open a war crimes inquiry, telling Paris it was using the allegations as a pretext to try to re-colonise Syria.</p>

<p>France said its counterterrorism prosecutor’s office had been handed the videos. “The alleged actions are likely to constitute the most serious international crimes, specifically crimes against humanity and war crimes. The fight against impunity is a matter of justice for the victims. It is also an essential prerequisite for building a lasting peace in Syria. After a decade of crimes against the Syrian people, France remains committed to ensuring that those responsible are brought to justice,” a government spokesperson said.</p>


<h2 id="2159845161540678168">French-German friendship ‘still alive’ as Macron meets Scholz amid tensions</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, hosted the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, for lunch on Wednesday as they sought to iron out significant differences on energy and defence that have weakened their relationship at a time of war in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Both leaders, whose countries are seen as the joint driving force of the European Union, made an effort to smile as Scholz emerged from his black Mercedes at the Élysée Palace to shake hands, but the German chancellor appeared to sidestep Macron’s attempts to put an arm around him.</p>

<p>The French government spokesperson Olivier Véran said the meeting showed that “this friendship remains alive”, after a cooling in relations led to the postponement of a joint French-German cabinet meeting. The French economy minister, Bruno Le Maire, had called for a “reset” amid rifts over defence strategy, the energy crisis, relations with China and even fiscal policy.</p>

<p>The two richest and most influential members of the EU have previously navigated occasional tensions in their relationship. But they have never been so much at odds at such a crucial time for Europe, with Russia’s war in Ukraine threatening the stability of the bloc, and other member countries such as Poland and the Baltic states questioning the Paris-Berlin dominance.</p>

<p>French officials have briefed that while the centrist Macron and Scholz’s predecessor, Angela Merkel, texted each other every day, Macron has had far less contact with Scholz, who heads a liberal-left coalition.</p>

<p>When Germany unveiled a €200bn package last month to shield its industry and consumers from soaring energy prices, France was not notified beforehand, leaving Paris rattled and concerned about an unfair advantage for German companies and threats to the EU’s single market. Then Germany’s refusal to consider an EU-wide energy price cap in response to Russia’s war on Ukraine irritated Paris and other European capitals, who feared the effect on their energy costs.</p>

<p>There has also been frostiness since Scholz announced a historic boost to defence spending. Even though Germany is going on a massive spending spree to modernise its military in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it is preferring to buy hardware such as new F-35 jets from across the Atlantic rather than from its neighbour. Given the urgency of the situation, government officials in Berlin say, quick delivery times have to take a priority over long-term industrial strategy.</p>

<p>France sees commitments to cooperate on defence procurement floundering, given Germany’s plans for a shared missile shield with other Nato nations using American equipment. Longer-term projects to jointly develop new fighter jets and tanks face reluctance from big arms companies.</p>

<p>The two countries have traditionally been brokers of compromise among the 27 members of the EU. But the German newspaper Die Welt said: “The Ukraine war has changed the disagreement between Germany and France at its core and thrown up the fundamental question of how far the two sides are still strategically compatible.”</p>

<p>Marie Krpata, a researcher on France and Germany at the French Institute of International Relations, said Macron’s credibility was at stake in repairing the Paris-Berlin relationship, particularly after the expectations created by Macron and Merkel’s 2020 agreement on a vast EU rescue fund to help European economies hit by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>“France sees itself as the political motor of the EU, where Germany is the economic motor,” she said. “Today Germany is being looked towards on energy, the economy and defence, so it is seeing its role grow.”</p>

<p>With Macron weakened on the domestic front after his centrist grouping lost its absolute majority in parliament in June elections, Krpata said: “Emmanuel Macron’s standing depends on the EU at the moment. He is weakened on internal politics so is trying to find his identity and profile through European action.”</p>

<p>The German opposition leader Friedrich Merz, of the conservative Christian Democratic Union, accused Scholz of isolating Germany within Europe. “The federal government has put great strain on Franco-German relations over the last few months,” he told the Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper. “The chancellor has to use his trip to get the Franco-German motor rolling again.”</p>


<h2 id="1082154473141439855">‘Get Igor Girkin’: hopes MH17 suspect could be captured fighting in Ukraine</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Piet Ploeg felt a glimmer of hope that justice would, at last, be served when he read the news that the prominent Russian nationalist Igor Girkin may be returning to the battlefield in Ukraine.</p>

<p>Ploeg’s brother, sister-in-law and nephew were killed alongside 295 other passengers and crew when the plane they boarded in Amsterdam on 17 July 2014 was shot down over Ukraine’s separatist-held territory of Donetsk by what international investigators believe was a Russian-made surface-to-air missile.</p>

<p>Dutch prosecutors say Girkin, who was a commander of the Kremlin-backed separatist forces during Vladimir Putin’s first invasion of Ukraine in 2014, helped supply the missile system used to shoot down the plane.</p>

<p>“We have to be realistic. The chances aren’t huge that Holland will get him. Ukraine first needs to capture him alive and then hand him over to us,” said Ploeg, who chairs the MH17 Disaster Foundation, a Dutch organisation that helps relatives of those killed in the downing of the flight.</p>

<p>“But it would be amazing if he can face the justice he deserves in court. Miracles do happen in this world,” he said.</p>

<p>The Dutch court is due to hand down its MH17 verdict on Girkin and three other defendants, who are all at large, on 17 November.</p>

<p>Girkin, who goes by the nom de guerre Igor Strelkov, has previously said he felt “a moral responsibility” for the deaths of the 298 people onboard the plane, but refused to admit to downing the passenger jet.</p>

<p>Speculations first arose that Girkin was bound for Ukraine following several days of silence on his Telegram channel.</p>

<p>Since the start of Russia’s invasion, Girkin emerged as arguably the most prominent voice within a group of ultranationalist and pro-war bloggers who have taken to berating the Kremlin for its military failures in Ukraine, amassing more than 750,000 followers on the messaging app.</p>

<p>Last Saturday, his wife, Myroslava Reginska, shared a photo on Girkin’s Telegram channel showing him in military fatigues.</p>

<p>“To answer the question, where is Igor Ivanovich,” she wrote, using his patronymic, “All is well! Will be in touch soon.”</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, Girkin posted a short message saying “Since October 14, 2022, I am in the active army.”</p>

<p>Ukrainians have since launched a crowdfunding campaign for his capture that has raised more than $150,000 (£135,000). Donors include local politicians and professional athletes.</p>

<p>Kyiv’s eagerness to capture Girkin, who once bragged that he had “pulled the trigger of war” in Ukraine, partly stems from the mounting evidence that he was guilty of war crimes during his time as a commander of Kremlin-backed separatist forces in 2014.</p>

<p>According to an investigation by Radio Free Europe, Girkin was responsible for ordering the executions by firing squad of at least three men in eastern Ukraine. In several interviews Girkin himself admitted to ordering the executions, saying he killed one of the men himself.</p>

<p>However, it remains to be seen whether Russia will allow the bellicose former commander to participate in the fighting.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, a picture was posted on social media of a man in military uniform who closely resembles Girkin. The Guardian has not confirmed the authenticity of the photo, but a group of activists on Twitter geolocated the image, claiming it was taken near the Russian city of Rostov, which borders Ukraine.</p>

<p>Readovka, a pro-Kremlin news site with ties to security services, claimed on Wednesday that Girkin was facing some resistance from the Russian military, who have reportedly pushed against his enlistment. “But he isn’t giving up … He is doing everything to go the front,” Readovka said.</p>

<p>In the event that Ukraine did capture Girkin, the Netherlands would be pushing for his extradition, said Sjoerd Sjoerdsma, a senior Dutch MP for the centre-left Democrats 66 party.</p>

<p>“When I heard about Ukraine’s crowdfunding campaign, I asked our government to double the money raised,” Sjoerdsma said.</p>

<p>The Netherlands will want to prevent a repeat of 2019, when Ukraine included Volodymyr Tsemakh, another suspect in the shooting down of MH17, in a major prisoner swap with Russia, placing him out of the reach of Dutch prosecutors.</p>

<p>“Ukraine has always been extremely helpful with the MH17 investigation but we have had an instance in the past where they traded an important suspect,” Sjoerdsma said, referring to Tsemakh. “I hope our government is already making concrete agreements with Ukraine on what will happen if they get Girkin.”</p>

<p>“It would be a dream scenario to have him in Dutch court come November,” the Dutch lawmaker said.</p>


<h2 id="1508089659139706779">‘Criminalizing kindness’: US woman arrested for feeding homeless people sues</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>A woman who was arrested for feeding homeless people in north-west Arizona is suing over a local ordinance that regulates food-sharing events in public parks, accusing the authorities of criminalizing kindness.</p>

<p>Norma Thornton, 78, became the first person arrested under Bullhead City’s ordinance in March for distributing prepared food from a van at Bullhead community park. Her lawyer said the lawsuit filed this week is part of a nationwide effort to let people feed those in need.</p>

<p>Criminal charges against Thornton were eventually dropped, but she is seeking an injunction to stop the city from enforcing the ordinance that took effect in May 2021.</p>

<p>“Bullhead City has criminalized kindness,” Thornton’s case attorney, Suranjan Sen, told Phoenix TV station KPHO. “The city council passed an ordinance that makes it a crime punishable by four months’ imprisonment to share food in public parks for charitable purposes.”</p>

<p>Bullhead City’s mayor, Tom Brady, said the ordinance applies only to public parks. He said churches, clubs and private properties are free to serve food to the homeless without a permit.</p>

<p>Thornton owned a restaurant for many years before retiring in Arizona and said she wanted to use her cooking skills to help the less fortunate.</p>

<p>“I have always believed that when you have plenty, you should share,” Thornton said.</p>

<p>According to the Mohave Valley Daily News, Thornton said she had continued to feed people in need, from private property not far from the community park.</p>

<p>Criminal charges were dropped “in the interest of justice” the city prosecutor, Martin Rogers, had said, according to the Mohave Valley Daily News, but Thornton later agreed to let the non-profit Institute for Justice take up a legal case.</p>

<p>“We are seeking an injunction,” the institute’s Sen said, the paper reported, with the aim that the authorities “cannot apply this ordinance against Norma or anybody else”.</p>

<p>The case claims the law infringes on Thornton’s right to carry out charitable acts.</p>


<h2 id="335228144203142145">‘It’s a therapeutic genre for me’: Iceland’s PM releases debut crime novel</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>For 30 years, the disappearance of teenager Lára Marteinsdóttir from the windswept island of Víðey, off the coast of Iceland’s capital, tormented the nation. Until 1986, when Valur, a rookie reporter on a local newspaper, decided to investigate …</p>

<p>So far, so Nordic noir. But Reykjavík, published to promising reviews in Iceland this week, is a crime novel with a difference – it was written by the prime minister, albeit with the help of one of the country’s international bestselling authors.</p>

<p>“I think every politician needs to have something to take his or her mind from the daily business of politics,” said Katrín Jakobsdóttir, who is on her second term as Iceland’s prime minister. “And I’ve been reading crime fiction all my life, so it’s kind of in my DNA.”</p>

<p>Katrín wrote her master’s thesis on the Icelandic crime novel, with special reference to the works of the original chart-topping master of the genre, Arnaldur Indriðason, whose books have sold more than 14m copies worldwide in 40 languages.</p>

<p>For Reykjavík, the Left-Green leader – who has said she was devouring Agatha Christie whodunnits by the age of eight – worked with Ragnar Jónasson, the bestselling author of the Dark Iceland series. He has sold three million books in 36 countries.</p>

<p>“In this story, we invite readers on a journey back to the summer when Reykjavík celebrated its 200th birthday and when Iceland’s first private radio and TV stations first started broadcasting, Ragnar, who has known Katrín since they sat on a crime fiction jury a decade ago, wrote in a Facebook post last month. “Reagan and Gorbachev’s Reykjavík summit was just around the corner – and that summer is also when unexpected clues about Lára’s fate come to light.” .</p>

<p>The prime minister told Agence France-Presse at the book’s launch that she had not thought writing a crime novel was something “I would have time to do”, but Covid had intervened. She had “no other interests” outside work, she joked.</p>

<p>“Every politician needs to have something to take his or her mind off the daily business of politics,” she said. Crime fiction was “a bit like psychotherapy. It’s really about solving crimes and finding justice, so it’s a very therapeutic genre for me.”</p>

<p>In a 2018 interview, she told the Guardian crime novels were a solid preparation for the less edifying aspects of the politician’s life. “They’re also about not really trusting anyone,” she said. “That’s generally how politics works.”</p>

<p>Katrín said she was expecting some tough reviews, but Egill Helgason, who hosts Iceland’s leading TV books show, said it was “well written, well researched” and “a very pleasant read … somewhat reminiscent of Agatha Christie”.</p>

<p>The novel, due out in the UK and US in August next year, is far from the first thriller to be written by a leading politician. Bill Clinton teamed up with James Patterson to co-write The President is Missing in 2018, followed by The President’s Daughter.</p>

<p>In Norway the former justice minister Anne Holt successfully channelled her experiences into a crime series translated into 25 languages, while in the UK the peers Jeffrey Archer and Michael Dobbs have both made fortunes from their literary endeavours.</p>

<p>In France, nine members of Emmanuel Macron’s first cabinet were published authors. Not all politicians’ books do well, though. Winston Churchill’s only novel, Savrola: A Tale of the Revolution in Laurania, garnered poor reviews – not least from the author. “I have consistently urged my friends to abstain from reading it,” he wrote in his 1930 autobiography.</p>


<h2 id="2277365092517321547">About 96,000 Haitians flee homes to escape gangs and kidnapping, UN says</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Gang violence, kidnapping and intimidation has forced about 96,000 people to flee their homes in Haiti’s capital, the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM) said on Friday, as the country faces a crisis that has prompted the government to request the immediate deployment of foreign troops.</p>

<p>The IOM said gang-related violence has led to “racketeering, kidnappings and wider criminal acts in a context characterized by deep inequalities, high levels of deprivation of basic human needs and a fragmented security environment”.</p>

<p>Gangs are believed to control some 60% of Port-au-Prince, raping women, children and men and setting homes on fire as they fight to control more territory in the wake of the July 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse, according to the UN.</p>

<p>Haitians also are struggling with dwindling supplies of fuel, water and other basic goods at the same time as a cholera outbreak, with concerns growing over the unhealthy state of government shelters where thousands of people have been living for months after fleeing gang violence.</p>

<p>At least 40 deaths from more than 1,700 suspected cholera cases have been reported, although health officials believe the number is much higher.</p>

<p>Another 17,000 people remain without a permanent home after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck south-west Haiti in August 2021, the IOM said.</p>

<p>The government this month requested help from foreign troops after one of Haiti’s most powerful gangs surrounded a key fuel terminal in Port-au-Prince in mid-September, forcing gas stations and key businesses to close.</p>

<p>The international community has sent Haiti armored vehicles and other equipment in recent weeks to help boost the national police force, but the UN security council has yet to vote on Henry’s request for troops.</p>


<h2 id="1589005104599720705">Kenyan police charged with crimes against humanity over 2017 crackdown</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>In a landmark decision, 12 Kenyan police officers will face charges of crimes against humanity over a deadly crackdown on post-election protests in 2017, prosecutors have announced.</p>

<p>The charges include rape, murder and torture and the case of a six-month-old girl whose death became a symbol of police brutality during the election aftermath.</p>

<p>“This is the first case of crimes against humanity charged under Kenyan domestic law using the International Crimes Act and also the first criminal prosecution of electoral-related sexual violence,” the director of public prosecutions (DPP), Noordin Haji, said on Friday.</p>

<p>An official at the prosecutor’s office said 12 mainly senior police officers were facing charges.</p>

<p>Dozens of people were killed over a four-month period during a police crackdown after the disputed presidential election in August 2017.</p>

<p>The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights documented 94 deaths during the crisis, as well as 201 cases of sexual violence and more than 300 injuries – most of which were attributed to security forces.</p>

<p>“The attacks were planned, coordinated and not random,” the DPP said, adding that various offences such as torture, rape and sexual violence “were committed by or under the authority of senior national police officers”.</p>

<p>The baby, Samantha Pendo, died after being beaten by police during a raid on her house as protests flared in the western city of Kisumu.</p>

<p>Officers fired teargas into their house and beat down the door before raining blows on the couple with batons while the mother held Samantha in her arms.</p>

<p>An autopsy showed that Samantha had sustained acute head injuries including a skull fracture.</p>

<p>A Kenyan inquest in 2019 found five police commanders liable for her death but although they were later convicted they have never served time behind bars.</p>

<p>Extrajudicial killings are rife in Kenya, and justice is rare, with few examples of police being held to account.</p>

<p>The new UN high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, welcomed the Kenyan prosecutor’s “groundbreaking” decision, saying it was “an important advance towards accountability for gross human rights violations in Kenya”.</p>

<p>Türk said it was “a positive step towards justice and accountability for survivors and families of victims, including in the context of electoral violence, and can strengthen prevention of future violations”.</p>

<p>Haji said on Friday that several people had been subjected to untold incidents of pain and suffering during the protest suppression.</p>

<p>“The operation had a well-organised command structure with sector commanders and was executed according to a consistent pattern,” he said.</p>

<p>Kenyan police are often accused by rights groups of using excessive force and carrying out unlawful killings, especially in poor neighbourhoods. They have also been accused in the past of running hit squads targeting those investigating alleged rights abuses by police.</p>

<p>This month the new president, William Ruto, disbanded a feared 20-year-old police unit accused of extrajudicial killings and vowed an overhaul of the security sector.</p>

<p>The 2017 protests erupted after victory was declared for then president Uhuru Kenyatta, angering supporters of his rival, the veteran opposition leader Raila Odinga.</p>

<p>The result was annulled by the supreme court after a challenge by Odinga but he boycotted the rerun, which was won by Kenyatta.</p>

<p>According to Missing Voices, a campaign group focused on extrajudicial killings in Kenya, there have been 1,264 deaths at the hands of police since it began collecting data in 2017.</p>


<h2 id="1768436238329765369">Fears Bolsonaro may not accept defeat as son cries fraud before Brazil election</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Fears are growing that Jair Bolsonaro could refuse to accept defeat in Brazil’s crunch election this Sunday after his politician son claimed Brazil’s far-right president was the victim of “the greatest electoral fraud ever seen” amid unproven allegations of foul play.</p>

<p>The assertion from the president’s senator son, Flávio Bolsonaro, was almost identical to language used by Donald Trump – Bolsonaro’s most prominent international backer – after he lost the 2020 US election to Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Trump used false claims of widespread voter fraud to decry “the greatest fraud in the history of our country from an electoral standpoint”. Weeks later, on 6 January 2021, pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol in a failed bid to overturn the result.</p>

<p>Many suspect Bolsonaro plans to follow a similar script if he loses to his leftist rival, the ex-president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who won the election’s first round on 2 October and currently leads the polls by a margin of between 4% and 5%.</p>

<p>Long-running fears that Bolsonaro – who has spent years attacking Brazil’s democratic system – might contest the result intensified on Monday after his communications minister, Fábio Faria, summoned journalists to denounce what he called “a grave violation of the electoral system”.</p>

<p>Without offering evidence, Faria claimed local radio stations in north-east Brazil had broadcast thousands more campaign adverts for the Lula campaign. “You need to get out and vote because we are being hamstrung,” he told supporters.</p>

<p>On Wednesday Brazil’s chief electoral justice, Alexandre de Moraes, rejected a petition from Bolsonaro’s campaign demanding the supposed irregularity be investigated. Moraes called instead for an investigation into whether the “unsubstantiated” claims were designed to “disrupt” the election.</p>

<p>But Bolsonaro doubled down on the claims, telling reporters the electoral process had been “unbalanced” in Lula’s favour.</p>

<p>“One side – my side – has been really disadvantaged,” claimed Bolsonaro, who Trump recently endorsed as “one of the great presidents of any country in the world”.</p>

<p>Flávio Bolsonaro compared the alleged campaign against his father to the failed attempt to assassinate the rightwing populist during 2018’s election, which he won.</p>

<p>“Bolsonaro has been knifed for a second time,” Bolsonaro tweeted, vowing: “We will win these elections, despite the attempt to manipulate the result.” In a second post, the senator claimed his father was the victim of “the greatest election fraud ever seen”.</p>

<p>Another pro-Bolsonaro senator, Lasier Martins, tweeted: “Postponing the election is the only solution!”</p>

<p>Thomas Traumann, a Rio-based political expert, called Bolsonaro’s claims of radio fraud “pure nonsense” and said he was convinced Bolsonaro was preparing to challenge the result of what is widely seen as Brazil’s most important election in decades.</p>

<p>“I have zero doubt – zero. He’s going to contest this,” Traumann said. “The question is the scale of the violence that challenge causes” among radical Bolsonaro followers.</p>

<p>Traumann added: “Trump is his idol and his model. And what did Trump do? He contested, he didn’t accept defeat, he called people on to the streets and encouraged violent protests and left power without backing down and continued to engage his followers so they didn’t recognize the authority of the new government and thus kept his base fired up. This, for me, is Bolsonaro’s roadmap.”</p>

<p>International observers are also fretting over how Bolsonaro might react if he loses when 156 million Brazilians return to the polls this weekend.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with the Guardian, the former US ambassador to Brazil Thomas Shannon voiced concern over Bolsonaro’s undermining of the electoral process.</p>

<p>“For me that can only have one purpose, which is to try to prevent an election from happening or change their course or outcome,” Shannon said, adding: “Bolsonaro and his team have looked very closely at what happened on January 6 trying to understand why it was that a sitting president failed in his effort to overturn election results.”</p>

<p>Shannon said he saw clear parallels between the politics of both countries. “The United States and Brazil are kind of like mirrors that reflect each other. Whatever happens in the United States happens in Brazil and whatever happens in Brazil happens in the United States.”</p>

<p>Brian Winter, a Brazil specialist who is editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly, said Bolsonaro’s questioning of the election’s fairness was “100%” Trump-inspired.</p>

<p>“They have noticed that January 6 and Trump’s continuous denial of the election has not cost him his future – as a matter of fact it may have saved it. Because this image of invincibility is so important to both of these movements – and the only way that Donald Trump could lose and survive was by insisting that he didn’t lose,” Winter said. “The Bolsonaros may have come to the same conclusion.”</p>

<p>Winter still believed it was possible Bolsonaro would not lose at all, pointing to how first round polls underestimated his support. Lula won the 2 October vote with 48.4% but Bolsonaro did much better than expected, taking 43.2% rather than the 36% or 37% pollsters had forecast.</p>

<p>“I still think this thing is going to go down to the wire and that you are going to have 215 million people simultaneously having heart attacks on Sunday night as the numbers come in,” Winter said.</p>

<p>“I still think he could win. I don’t think it’s the most likely outcome – but we’ll see.”</p>


<h2 id="837051121604704285">Pokémon still going: Taiwan’s love affair with the game the world forgot</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>We can’t show you Tsai’s face. The 52-year-old is busily swiping away at six phones in a custom-built usher-style tray. Charging cords snake off into a backpack full of powerbanks. The elaborate setup is designed to maximise his Pokémon Go experience, ensuring he’s always in hunt-mode.</p>

<p>Tsai started in 2016 with just one phone, but says six is the perfect number to avoid waiting for his device to process all the “boring” bells and whistles each time he catches one of the virtual creatures.</p>

<p>He’s excited to talk to us, Tsai says without looking up, and ordinarily he’d be happy to pose. But he came to Taipei from Kaohsiung 350km away and his wife thinks he’s on a work trip.</p>

<p>Marital risks aside, Tsai believes Pokémon Go has had a positive impact on his life. “It’s good for exercise,” he says.</p>

<p>Pokémon Go is an augmented reality mobile game that allows users to hunt “pocket monsters” – like Pikachu, Bulbasaur, Charizard and Squirtle – in public. When it was released in 2016, 500m downloads were recorded in its first six months. The news was filled with stories of people blindly chasing the characters across cities, into lakes and deserts, even trespassing into biker-gang clubhouses. While it remains one of the world’s most popular phone games, global user numbers have plummeted in recent years. By June, monthly users had dropped to about 80 million worldwide, with just 10% of them logging in daily.</p>

<p>In Taiwan, however, it remains hugely popular across all age groups. Young adults grew up on the cartoons and Nintendo games and embraced the mobile version, sharing it with their parents and grandparents. It also taps into a Taiwanese love of Japanese culture and cute things generally.</p>

<p>Around Taipei, which has some of the world’s most densely populated neighbourhoods, dozens of people can often be found loitering in parks and outside banks or post offices, waiting for a “raid”. At a death metal concert in Wanhua, a young woman dressed all in black crowdsurfed while clutching a Pikachu plush toy. In September, the national airline unveiled a Pokémon-liveried aircraft. In 2021, a Pokémon-themed 7-Eleven opened in Taipei.</p>

<p>Niantic, Pokémon Go’s parent company, holds its data incredibly tight. It won’t give country-specific user statistics, or attendance figures for the sold-out Taipei event. But Niantic’s Asia Pacific events manager, Go Nagano, says that per capita, Taiwan is one of the company’s top markets, and Taipei hosts the world’s most visited “gym”, a virtual battleground for teams. In 2021, Taiwan recorded the second highest average number of kilometres walked by Pokémon Go users, and consumer data showed that Taiwanese people spent almost three times as long playing the game as Japanese users.</p>

<p>One of the first post-Covid international events in Taiwan is a three-day Pokémon Go Safari in Taipei’s Da’an Forest Park, arranged with local tourism departments to promote the city. Mobile carrier trucks are on site to temporarily boost 4G and 5G signals for the hundreds of people walking around slowly and staring at their phones.</p>

<p>Some are in homemade costumes or themed outfits, and there are a variety of bespoke charging solutions. Multiple phones are common. A young man wears a laminated sign advertising potential Pokémon trades and is quickly surrounded. A woman in her 50s wearing a hot-pink rain jacket boisterously bargains with him. Surnamed Huang, she proudly says she has a rare Pokémon from Greece, which she traded from a mysterious visitor. Asked for details, Huang grows suspicious. Are we spies? We honestly don’t know how to answer.</p>

<p>Keiko Maeda, an 85-year-old Japanese retiree says she was bored at home, wanting to exercise and kill time during the pandemic. So she hired a private tutor, first to teach her how to use a mobile phone and then to teach her how to play the game. A year later, she has flown in from Tokyo, alone, just for this event.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know if I’d be able to come to Taiwan again because of Covid, so I’m happy to be here,” she says through a translator.</p>

<p>Maeda is the oldest player the Guardian meets, but isn’t an outlier. The game is hugely popular among elderly people in Taiwan, which like much of east Asia has a rapidly ageing population. Taipei’s most famous player, who has recently retired after suffering a stroke, is a 74-year-old grandfather named Chen Sun-yuan, who would ride around on his bicycle with 64 phones attached to the handlebars.</p>

<p>Young people joke the game is a form of aged care – getting their elderly relatives outside for exercise and socialising. “It’s a positive game for retired people, it gives them a goal, there are group events, they meet people,” says one younger player.</p>

<p>At Da’an park the amount of time spent playing each day is split pretty cleanly along generational lines. Younger people, like 35-year-old Jason, “don’t have time to be addicted”, and claim they limit themselves to between 30 minutes and two hours a day. Most in this age group cite nostalgia when asked why they like the game. They grew up watching the cartoons and now play the phone game with friends and siblings. Some have brought their – often visibly disinterested – young children with them.</p>

<p>“But the aunties and uncles spend all day playing it,” he says.</p>

<p>Back at the pagoda, something on the screen catches Tsai’s eye and he attaches a neck strap to the tray to go for a wander around the park. He is firmly in the enthusiast camp, but says he has his limits. “In Kaohsiung I saw people walking into the sea to catch Pokémon. I’m not that crazy.”</p>


<h2 id="276268244325935571">Suspected Russian spy arrested in Norway spent years studying in Canada</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>A suspected Russian spy who posed as a Brazilian academic before his arrest this week by Norway’s domestic security agency spent years studying at Canadian universities with a focus on Arctic security issues.</p>

<p>The man, who called himself José Assis Giammaria, worked as researcher at the University of Tromsø and was arrested on suspicion he had entered Norway under false pretences. On Friday, prosecutor Thomas Blom named the man as Mikhail Mikushin, adding that Norway’s domestic security agency was “not positively sure of his identity, but we are quite certain that he is not Brazilian”.</p>

<p>A researcher at the investigative website Bellingcat said that evidence suggested that Mikushin is a senior Russian military intelligence officer.</p>

<p>“Great job, Norway, you’ve caught yourself a colonel from the GRU [Russia’s military intelligence agency],” Christo Grozev tweeted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more details emerged of the years the man lived in Canada, amid speculation that he used his time in the country to build up the cover story of his fake identity.</p>

<p>After his arrest, Gunhild Hoogensen Gjørv, a professor in security studies at the University of Tromsø, told the Guardian that the man had come recommended by a Canadian professor.</p>

<p>In 2015, a José Assis Giammaria graduated with a bachelor of arts in political science from Ottawa’s Carleton University, focusing on international relations with a minor in communications studies.</p>

<p>That same year, he volunteered for the country’s New Democratic party during the federal election, knocking on doors for candidate Sean Devine.</p>

<p>Devine, now a city councillor, told local media nothing unusual jumped out about Giammaria except for an impressive résumé and strong speaking skills.</p>

<p>The suspect moved west and three years later graduated from the University of Calgary with a master’s degree in strategic studies.</p>

<p>“Students in this program are taught by professors and instructors – not military professionals – to build a well-rounded understanding of the drivers of military, security and strategic decision-making,” the university said in a statement.</p>

<p>It added that the suspect would not have had any unique access to information, but cautioned questions over a possible criminal background or identify fraud were the purview of the federal government “as part of the immigration process”.</p>

<p>Staff at the Centre for Military, Security and Strategic Studies have told reporters that they did not recall the man, despite him using a number of references from Canada when he applied for a position in Tromsø.</p>

<p>The suspect appeared to take an interest in Arctic policy and in 2019 published an article in the Naval Review journal on the need for Canada to establish a permanent naval base in its Arctic territory, arguing Nordic nations – and Russia – had already done so. He also highlighted the significant Russian investment in the region and suggested Canada lacked the “political will” to match other nations competing for a place in the Arctic.</p>

<p>“We have no way of assessing the security status of people who submit articles – we simply judge the submissions on their merits,” the journal’s editor, Ann Griffiths, told the Guardian in an email. “People submit material, and if it’s good/interesting we publish it.”</p>

<p>Canada, alongside South American countries, has long been a site for Soviet and Russian programs to create deep-cover identities for “illegals” – agents who operate covertly and without diplomatic cover, said Stephanie Carvin, a professor of international relations at Carleton University and former national security analyst.</p>

<p>The country’s lack of a centralized birth and death record-keeping system makes it relatively easy to appropriate an identity, she said.</p>

<p>And while the case exemplifies the way in which Russia has not dramatically changed its tactics, it also underscores the sustained nature of “traditional espionage”.</p>

<p>“You still need human intelligence. You still need people out there doing things in order to achieve a state aim or goal. Even if it’s a pretty traditional tactic, it’s never really gone away.”</p>

<p>Carvin says she suspected the Russian’s time in Canada was used to develop a deep cover or backstory, known as a “legend”, for use in possible missions outside the country.</p>

<p>“Canada, generally speaking, is a non-specific country. It’s a good place to burnish your legend without raising too many red flags,” she said. “The whole point of the legend is you don’t want to stick out at all. You want to seem extremely boring and plain. And Canada fits the bill.”</p>


<h2 id="2158880914850791585">Russia says 82,000 conscripts from emergency draft already in Ukraine</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Russia’s defence minister said 82,000 conscripts had already been sent to Ukraine, reflecting what the west called a desperate effort to halt Kyiv’s counter offensive with poorly trained troops.</p>

<p>Sergei Shoigu told president, Vladimir Putin, that a further 218,000 were being trained in barracks, and that the controversial “partial mobilisation” had concluded, although it was not possible to verify the figures cited.</p>

<p>The meeting between the two was broadcast on Russian state television, with Shoigu telling Putin: “The task set by you of (mobilising) 300,000 people has been completed. No further measures are planned.”</p>

<p>The emergency draft began in September, after Ukraine won a string of victories in the north-west near Kharkiv, prompting some Russians to protest and others to flee the country. Dozens of conscripts have been killed after being thrown into the frontline to protect more experienced troops in the rear.</p>

<p>Britain’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday that Russia was seeking to consolidate its existing gains after eight months of hard fighting by relying on “severely undermanned, poorly trained force” that were “only capable of defensive operations”.</p>

<p>But, despite the critical analysis, there are signs that the growing use of conscripts by Russia has slowed Ukraine’s advance in both the east and the south of the country, as the autumn turns towards winter.</p>

<p>Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of the east Luhansk region, said “the advance of Ukrainian troops forward is not going as fast as we would like it to” in a television interview, because Russia has managed to recover its reserves and dig in.</p>

<p>Thousands of conscripts had been deployed in places such as Bakhmut, where Haidai said they were being killed or wounded quickly after being thrown into battle against dug-in Ukrainians. “The average ‘shelf life’ of mobilised personnel is about two weeks,” the governor added.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s general staff said on Friday that up to 1,000 Russian conscripts had been sent across the Dnipro River to fortify Kherson, demonstrating that the Kremlin is unwilling to give up the city without some sort of a fight. The troops would be billeted in homes belonging to residents who had fled the war.</p>

<p>A week ago it appeared that Russia feared losing the city and had relocated commanding officers across to the east bank of the river – and begun evacuating civilians, an exercise that Ukraine said amounted to forced deportations.</p>

<p>Ukraine retook a string of villages near Kherson in early October, but earlier this week defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, warned that the autumn rains had “slowed us down a bit” and progress had become gradual.</p>

<p>Locals say the terrain between the Ukrainian held city of Mykolaiv and Kherson is particularly difficult because the flat ground is cut by large irrigation canals, some of which have been drained, but in either case are easily fortified.</p>

<p>Western military experts have long predicted a slow down in the tempo of fighting in November as heavy rains clog the ground and make it increasingly difficult for armoured vehicles to operate off road. The battle may not pick up again until the depths of winter, when the ground freezes.</p>

<p>Kherson’s Russian appointed governor said earlier this week that the tomb and remains of Prince Grigory Potemkin, once the chief minister and lover of 18th century ruler Catherine the Great, had been taken from a cathedral in Kherson and moved deeper into occupied territory.</p>

<p>“We have moved the remains of his serene highness Prince Potemkin from St Catherine’s church and the monument itself to the left bank,” east of the Dnipro River, Volodymyr Saldo said, according to Russian state news agency reports.</p>

<p>Another Russian official said the evacuation of civilians from Kherson had concluded. “The work to organise residents leaving to the left bank of the Dnipro to safe regions of Russia is completed,” said Sergei Aksyonov, the Moscow-appointed head of Crimea, late on Thursday, after a visit to the area.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s air force said it has shot down more than 300 Iranian Shahed-136 ‘kamikaze’ drones so far, although that figure is only a fraction of the 2,400 that the country believes Russia has acquired from Tehran.</p>

<p>Russia has used the hard to detect drones to help target Ukraine’s power stations and energy grid during October. Power blackouts, aimed at destabilising the energy supply, are now routine in many of the country’s major cities.</p>

<p>Vitali Klitschko, the mayor of Kyiv, said that the city’s power grid was operating in “emergency mode,” with electricity supplies down by as much as a half compared with prewar levels. Four hour blackouts have been announced in and around the capital.</p>

<p>Oleg Syniehubov, the governor of the Kharkiv region, announced on Telegram that daily one-hour power outages would begin on Monday, including the regional capital, which is Ukraine’s second-largest city.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s presidential office said that at least four civilians have been killed and 10 others wounded by the latest Russian attacks, with heavy shelling damaging dozens of residential buildings and power lines near the southern city of Nikopol.</p>


<h2 id="1788069256350016761">‘It’s my frontline and I won’: the chef putting Ukrainian cuisine back on the map</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>In a war, there are many different fronts, and many different forms of resistance. Ievgen Klopotenko, a Ukrainian chef, is fighting his war with soup.</p>

<p>In defiance of the Russian cruise missile and drone attacks that have hit Kyiv recently, Klopotenko, 35, was last week presiding over his bustling city centre restaurant. On the menu were dishes such as beetroot and herring salad with smoked pear from the Odesa region, venison from the Carpathians, and a dessert named “Kherson is Ukraine”.</p>

<p>Alongside a citrus semifreddo, the pudding included watermelon he had bought last season in Kherson and fermented. The region, which Vladimir Putin claimed to have annexed last month but is now the site of fierce fighting, is famous for the fruit.</p>

<p>And, of course, Klopotenko was serving borscht. In this case, with a touch of plum jam to balance out the sourness of the beetroot. For a hint of smokiness, it had been cooked slow and low in a wood-fired oven, as if “under a duvet”.</p>

<p>He insists it is a Ukrainian dish rather than a Russian one. Like many aspects of Ukrainian culture, it was absorbed and appropriated by the Soviet Union during the 20th century, he argued.</p>

<p>Not everyone agrees. In 2019, a Russian government account tweeted that the beetroot-based soup was “one of Russia’s most famous & beloved dishes”, while the Russian embassy in Washington said borscht was a national dish of many countries, including Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Moldova and Romania.</p>

<p>In retaliation, Klopotenko spearheaded a move to persuade Unesco to inscribe Ukrainian borscht on its list of intangible world heritage assets.</p>

<p>Despite a Russian foreign ministry spokesperson denouncing Ukrainian’s failure to “share” borscht as “xenophobia, extremism and nazism” in April this year, Klopotenko’s attempt was successful. Ukrainian borscht was fast-tracked on to the Unesco list in July. (“Borscht cooking is also practised in communities in the broader region,” the official inscription states, diplomatically.)</p>

<p>“It’s my frontline and I think I won,” said Klopotenko.</p>

<p>In truth, though, that was just a battle. His longer-term war is to rediscover and revive traditional Ukrainian recipes and ingredients – in turn contributing, he hopes, to the Ukrainian people’s renewed sense of identity. “If we eat Ukrainian food then we will become Ukrainian,” he said.</p>

<p>About eight years ago it dawned on him that the only traditional Ukrainian dishes most people could name were borscht and varenyky – dumplings stuffed with potatoes, meat or sometimes cherries. What was actually being eaten was “Russian, Russian or Russian – or actually, Soviet Union food”, he said. “Potato puree, cutlets, pickled vegetables.”</p>

<p>The key note of Soviet food was blandness, he said. Until recently, for example, Ukraine’s Soviet-era guidelines for school dinners still explicitly excluded spices and herbs, with the sole exception of pepper. But in 2018, in a Jamie-Oliver-style effort at change, Klopotenko introduced dishes such as shepherd’s pie, curry and macaroni cheese to school menus.</p>

<p>Not Ukrainian dishes, to be sure, but nutritious meals that were also, in their small way, a geopolitical statement. “When you are open to the world, you’ll be part of the world,” he said. “If you are not afraid of oregano, you will not be afraid of Greece and Italy.”</p>

<p>To rehabilitate Ukrainian food, Klopotenko turned detective, delving back into the country’s pre-Soviet past. (The name of his restaurant, 100 Rokiv Tomu Vpered, or 100 Years Back to the Future, refers to this dive into culinary history.)</p>

<p>He started with books. As we talked, surrounded by diners tucking into galushki – dumplings with meat and cherries from the Poltava region – he dumped a trio of volumes on the table.</p>

<p>The first was a poem by the founder of modern Ukrainian literature, Ivan Kotliarevsky. His Eneïda, published in sections from 1798, is a jokey reworking of Virgil’s epic poem the Aeneid – with Cossacks instead of Trojans. “The characters do a lot of fighting and drinking and eating,” said Klopotenko. About 150 dishes are mentioned by name, “only two or three of which are eaten now”.</p>

<p>Still, that gave him the conviction that at one time Ukrainian cuisine had been rich and various. The second work was Practical Kitchen, Ukraine’s first cookery book, published in 1929. The author was Olha Franko, the daughter-in-law of the prolific writer and translator Ivan Franko, a towering figure in Ukrainian literary history. She offered recipes for a handful of the dishes mentioned by Kotliarevsky.</p>

<p>The third was a volume published in 1913 called Food and Drink of Ukraine. It is ascribed to a figure called Zinaida Klynovetska, now thought to be a pseudonym for writers assembling Ukrainian recipes facing the threat of persecution for nationalism under the Russian empire.</p>

<p>Klopotenko then took research trips around the country, learning about surviving regional food traditions in regions from the Carpathian mountains to Odesa, as well as investigating Tatar food from Crimea which, he insisted, was part of Ukraine. Russia’s annexation of the region in 2014 remains unrecognised by most UN countries.</p>

<p>It is highly refined versions of some of these recipes, using ingredients from Ukraine’s rich agricultural lands, that he serves in his restaurant.</p>

<p>Since the invasion he has also been running a canteen for refugees and volunteers in Lviv, in western Ukraine, and posting dozens of recipe videos online – giving people “an opportunity not to think about the war” while learning to cook Ukrainian.</p>

<p>“I understood that I had to fight on this frontline – this cultural frontline,” he said.</p>

<p>And then there is the unifying power of soup. Each Ukrainian family had its own, slightly different recipe, he said. “But it’s still borscht. Just like us Ukrainians – we are all so free and so different.”</p>

<p>He added: “The only thing this country unites around is borscht. You can like [President Volodymyr] Zelenskiy or not, but no one in Ukraine would say: ‘I don’t like borscht.’”</p>


<h2 id="1044847209380677977">‘Nobody forced us’: the Greek builder who saved 80 Afghans from the sea</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Michalis Protopsaltis does not see himself as a hero. When the news of the shipwreck came through, he did, he says, what any man in his position would do. The construction company owner dispatched a crane to the Kythira clifftop and, one by one, began saving the 80 Afghan immigrants scrambling for dear life in the waters below.</p>

<p>Three hours elapsed before the last refugee – originally bound for Italy on a yacht that had set sail from the Turkish town of İzmir – was winched to the top.</p>

<p>When he appeared, sodden and shell-shocked in the sand bag attached to the crane, Protopsaltis felt a pang of relief but also nausea at what he had seen: the men, women and children who had not been saved, who had flailed about in the sea, screaming and shouting as they tried to scale the jagged rocksthat had shipwrecked the boat.</p>

<p>On Monday, almost three weeks after the dramatic scenes unfolded on the island, the 66-year-old will be honoured in a ceremony at Athens’ ministry of maritime affairs. The events of that night, both tragic and awe-inspiring, are still reverberating. The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has telephoned to thank him personally.</p>

<p>“What we witnessed that night was hellish, absolutely frightful, something I never thought I would ever see,” Protopsaltis told the Guardian. The sea was howling, the wind was howling, the waves were just so big and all these people down there in that rocky cove, trying to keep steady, trying somehow to get into the bag, sometimes two at a time but mostly one at a time, so the crane could lift them to the top.”</p>

<p>“Neither I, nor anyone else who was there, and there must have been around 100 of us, thought twice,” he said, adding that with the aid of ropes at least 20 had also survived. “Nobody forced us to help. All this talk about Greeks letting migrants die in the sea has infuriated me because it’s not true.”</p>

<p>The Greek media has also gone to town hailing the heroism of a man who could easily have chosen not to act when the yacht – a vessel with a maximum passenger capacity of 15 but carrying 95 people – ran aground off Diakofti, Kythira’s main port. Even his sisters in Sydney – for no Greek isle has seen more of its community migrate to Australia than Kythira – have been in touch to say they have seen him on CNN.</p>

<p>Only now, Protopsaltis concedes, has the “significance and value” of what he, and his fellow Kythirians achieved, hit home. “All this talk about heroism is overblown. What we did was only human. In Kythira we always help people in need. From America and Argentina to South Africa and Australia there are Kytherians and, so, all of us have lived the experience of migration. I don’t know what has been happening further afield [in Greece] but we’d never let people drown.”</p>

<p>Located off the south-east tip of the Peloponnese, between the Greek peninsula and Crete, Kythira (population 3,600) lies about 250 miles west of Turkey. The island is now on a route increasingly used by smugglers trying to avoid reinforced patrols in the east Aegean and travelling directly to Italy. Since August there have been five landings of boats on Kythira.</p>

<p>Further east on the day of the shipwreck, the bodies of 16 young African women were found floating off Lesbos. The two incidents, followed by the discovery of 92 naked people on Greece’s land border with Turkey, have further strained already tense ties between the two countries, with Athens accusing Ankara of deliberately ignoring people smugglers working along the Turkish coastline. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has countered that Greece’s “oppressive policies” towards asylum seekers, including forcible evictions or pushbacks, has turned the Aegean into “a graveyard”.</p>

<p>The allegations of pushbacks – which are being facilitated by the EU border agency, Frontex, according to rights groups – has put a stain on Greece’s human rights record and embarrassed officials in Brussels where the bloc’s external border management policies, more generally, have come under criticism.</p>

<p>Athens’ centre-right government has repeatedly denied indulging in summary deportations, claiming Turkey is deliberately “pushing forward” people across the land and sea frontiers that separate the two countries. Greece’s migration minister, Notis Mitarachi, has vowed to put what he has denounced as Turkey’s “weaponisation of migration” at the top of the agenda when he meets the UN general assembly president, Csaba Kőrösi, in New York this week.</p>

<p>In a country that saw large numbers of refugees arrive at the height of Syria’s civil war, and initially greeted with extraordinary compassion, the talk of pushbacks is either ignored by a media machine that is heavily pro-government or politicised by an opposition desperate to score points.</p>

<p>But for Protopsaltis politics played no part in the rescue even if he readily admits he is a government supporter. “There were people in danger, whose lives were at risk, all anyone thought about was how they could be saved,” he said.</p>

<p>“The truth is that civilised people want to behave in a civilised way. It was only when I got home that it occurred that while they accuse us of doing all these things, here we are, a group of people on a little island in Greece who saved 80 souls tonight because it was the right thing to do.”</p>

<h2 id="385080507576469380">Russia-Ukraine war at a glance: what we know on day 247 of the invasion</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>
• None The war in Ukraine has seen Russia launch more than 8,000 airstrikes and fire 4,500 missiles, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed. Standing beside the wreckage of a downed Iranian drone, he vowed that Putin’s attacks on power plants would not break Ukrainian spirits. Russia had aimed dozens of missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles at Ukraine’s electricity network causing widespread power cuts over the last two weeks, with Ukraine shooting down 23 drones in the past two days alone.
• None Ukraine has shot down more than 300 Iranian Shahed-136 “kamikaze” drones so far, an air force spokesperson, Yuriy Ihnat, told a briefing on Friday. The drones have become a key weapon in Russia’s arsenal during its war in Ukraine and have often been used in the past month to target crucial energy infrastructure. Iran has denied Ukrainian and western accusations that it is supplying drones to Russia.
• None The US and its allies condemned Russia for wasting the time of the UN security council and spreading conspiracies by again raising its accusation that the US has “military biological programmes” in Ukraine. “How much more of this nonsense do we have to endure?” the UK’s ambassador to the UN, Barbara Woodward, asked the council. Russia has previously raised at least twice at the security council the issue of biological weapons programmes in Ukraine – while Washington and Kyiv say they do not exist. Russia is pushing for a formal inquiry.
• None The US has dismissed Russian accusations it is helping Ukraine engage with banned biological weapons. It claims Russia is attempting to “distract from the atrocities” being carried out in Ukraine, calling the allegations “pure fabrications brought forth without a shred of evidence”.
• None Russia has bolstered its troops with “mobilised reservists” west of the Dnieper River, the UK’s MoD says. Over the past six weeks, its ground forces have transitioned to a “defensive posture” on the frontline, likely due to being “severely undermanned” and “poorly trained”.
• None The EU has appointed the Polish general Piotr Trytek to lead a new training operation with Ukrainian troops. Trytek, 51, was chosen by the bloc as part of its pledge to step up military support for Ukraine.
• None President Vladimir Putin’s first deputy chief of staff visited the Russian-held Ukrainian city of Kherson. Sergei Kiriyenko stopped at the ferry port where hundreds of people were being removed after a warning from authorities.
• None A Russian official’s threat to “strike” western satellites aiding Ukraine has raised concerns among space lawyers and industry executives about the safety of objects in orbit. No country has carried out a missile strike against an enemy’s satellite.
• None UN nuclear inspectors are expected to reach conclusion on “dirty bomb”. Investigators are being sent to two locations in Ukraine where Russia alleged the activities were taking place, and are expected to reach a conclusion “in days”.
• None Russia claims only 3% of food exported under the UN-brokered Black Sea export deal has gone to the poorest countries. Several tonnes of grain have left blockaded Ukrainian ports since the contract was signed. However, Russia says Ukraine has failed to deliver humanitarian food assistance.
• None The US is sceptical of Putin’s claim to have no intention of using nuclear weapons. Putin had played down a nuclear standoff, insisting Russia had not threatened to use nuclear weapons, and had only responded to nuclear “blackmail” from western leaders.
• None Putin has said the war in Ukraine is part of Russia’s wider struggle against western domination. “We are standing at a historical frontier: Ahead is probably the most dangerous, unpredictable and, at the same time, important decade since the end of World War Two,” he said. The Ukraine offensive, he said in a speech addressed to the Valdai Discussion Club, a gathering of Russian specialists, on Thursday. He added the war was simply part of the “tectonic shifts of the entire world order” and that “the historical period of the west’s undivided dominance over world affairs is coming to an end”.</p>

<h2 id="1621397768710793410">Climate crisis fuelling unseasonably warm October in UK and Europe, say experts</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Three months ago, Britain experienced its hottest day on record. Records were similarly broken in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands as an extreme heatwave swept across much of Europe.</p>

<p>Now, with much of western Europe experiencing unusually mild autumnal temperatures caused by the jet stream – strong winds blowing from west to east – figures are expected to reach 20C this weekend in parts of Britain, Germany, France and elsewhere, according to national weather services.</p>

<p>While scientists say much of this is part of a natural weather pattern, or the “luck of the draw”, they say it is clear that the climate crisis is contributing to higher temperatures.</p>

<p>“Part of this [jet stream] is a natural weather pattern,” said Peter Stott, a climate change expert.</p>

<p>“But again the impact is being exacerbated by climate change, because it’s giving us not just the warmer temperatures when we have these types of weather patterns, but also giving us higher rainfall when we get it,” he said.</p>

<p>In the coming days, the Met Office forecasts it will be unusually warm in much of mainland Europe, not just the UK, which has been experiencing temperatures above average. The unseasonably high temperatures are expected to drop in November, however, bringing changeable and unsettled conditions, according to the Met Office.</p>

<p>“It’s not necessarily clear that these jet stream shifts are necessarily linked to climate change in and of themselves” said Christopher O’Reilly, a research fellow at the University of Reading’s meteorology department. “But it’s very clear that when you have these particular conditions given the warming climate, they obviously bring warmer temperatures.”</p>

<p>The mild temperatures come amid dire concerns from the UN’s environment agency, which says countries’ pledges to cut carbon emissions have been “woefully inadequate”. An analysis by the world’s leading energy organisation found global carbon emissions from energy will peak in 2025 thanks to increased government spending on clean fuels in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.</p>

<p>Climate Central, an independent group of scientists, launched an online tool on Thursday quantifying the contribution of climate change to global daily temperatures in real time.</p>

<p>While high October temperatures in the UK are not unusual – the past decade has seen several examples above 20C, including 23.9C (75F) in 2018 and 29.9C (86F) in 2011 – Europe stood out globally in recent days with very strong climate shift index scores, said Andrew Pershing, director of climate science at Climate Central.</p>

<p>Index scores in the UK are currently at level two, meaning temperatures are twice as likely due to climate change, according to the platform. In southern Europe, across the coasts of Spain, France and Italy, scores are as high as three or four.</p>

<p>“At these levels – level two, level three – we tend to talk about that as climate change is playing a significant role in boosting the odds of the temperatures that you’re experiencing today,” said Pershing.</p>

<p>“This is signalling to you that you know that these are the conditions that are going to become more common in your location,” he said. “While the fall conditions are certainly unusual in Europe right now, they’re going to become more and more common as the years go on and as climate change progresses.”</p>

<h2 id="1106718151317964190">Why does the US allow a controversial weedkiller banned across the world?</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>When US regulators issued a 2019 assessment of the widely used farm chemical paraquat, they determined that even though multiple scientific studies linked the chemical to Parkinson’s disease, that work was outweighed by other studies that did not find such links.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reiterated its assessment in a 2021 report, determining that when weighing all the risks and benefits, US farmers could continue to apply the weedkiller across millions of US acres to help in the production of soybeans, corn, cotton and an array of other crops.</p>

<p>This is in stark contrast to the EU, where it is banned. It is also outlawed in the UK, where it is manufactured; Switzerland, where its manufacturer, Syngenta, is based; and China, the home of Syngenta’s parent company.</p>

<p>A growing chorus of US farm worker, health and environmental advocacy groups is demanding that this must change. They argue that research conducted by independent scientists provides abundant evidence of paraquat’s ability to cause Parkinson’s and other health dangers, and the EPA is improperly discounting that body of research.</p>

<p>Last week the Guardian and the New Lede reported that internal corporate documents suggested Syngenta had feared a link to Parkinson’s for decades. It sought both to refute the evidence with studies authored by its own scientists, and to influence the makeup of influential EPA panels that advise on pesticide regulation.</p>

<p>Syngenta cites the EPA assessment of the science on paraquat in defense of the pesticide, and says scientific research “does not support” a causal relationship between the chemical and the disease. On a Syngenta-run paraquat information website, the company highlights several studies it says also backs that position, including many conducted by company scientists or by outside scientists who received company funding for their work.</p>

<p>“Recent thorough reviews performed by the most advanced and science-based regulatory authorities, including the United States and Australia, continue to support the view that paraquat is safe,” Syngenta said in a statement to the Guardian.</p>

<p>The company is facing calls in the US for a paraquat ban, as well as more than 2,000 legal claims brought by people alleging they developed Parkinson’s disease because of their exposure to paraquat.</p>

<p>More than 50 groups have called for the US to follow the lead of dozens of other countries in banning paraquat. The Michael J Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research submitted a petition to the EPA with 107,000 signatories calling for a ban. The foundation cited a study that found people exposed to paraquat in their teens or as young adults had an increased Parkinson’s risk of 200 to 600%, depending on the overall exposure.</p>

<p>In a 2022 court filing, a contingent of eight such organizations accused the EPA of violating its own risk assessment practices to dismiss what research shows about the connection between paraquat and Parkinson’s. They told the court there was a “substantial body of evidence” of paraquat’s ability to cause Parkinson’s through “chronic, low-dose” exposures, along with connections to other health dangers.</p>

<p>Parkinson’s is an incurable progressive nervous system disorder that severely limits a person’s ability to control movement. It can cause tremors, loss of balance and eventually often leaves victims bedridden and/or relying on a wheelchair. Parkinson’s symptoms develop when dopamine-producing neurons in the brain degenerate.</p>

<p>Scientists studying Parkinson’s say research shows genetics play only a small role in causation, and the majority of cases are considered to be triggered by environmental exposures. Along with exposure to paraquat and other pesticides, inhalation of small particles of toxins in polluted air is also seen as a possible cause of the disease. Farmers and farm workers who use pesticides are particularly prone to the disease.</p>

<p>Some of the most debated scientific research when it comes to paraquat and Parkinson’s disease are studies conducted as part of the federally supported US Agricultural Health Study (AHS). The AHS started in 1993 as a research project examining the health effects of pesticides on farmers and other pesticide applicators. More than 89,000 farmers and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina have participated.</p>

<p>In 2011, AHS researchers reported that study participants who used paraquat or another pesticide called rotenone were more than twice as likely to develop Parkinson’s disease as people who didn’t use the chemicals.</p>

<p>But in a 2020 update, AHS researchers indicated the findings from 2011 with respect to paraquat were not seen again. The EPA points to the study as support for its finding of insufficient evidence linking paraquat to Parkinson’s, saying the updated study “reported no association” between paraquat exposure and Parkinson’s disease. And in a statement to the Guardian, Syngenta called the 2020 work “the most comprehensive study of pesticide use and Parkinson’s disease to date”.</p>

<p>Still, critics say the updated study suffered from multiple flaws, including the fact that there was a sizable drop off in the follow-up with study participants. And they point to the fact that even the 2020 AHS researchers acknowledged in their published paper that there were “several limitations” with the study.</p>

<p>And despite the characterization from Syngenta, the AHS researchers said in their paper that when it comes to paraquat, “animal and earlier human studies offer persuasive evidence for a potential link” with Parkinson’s. They said they could not rule out the possibility of an association between paraquat and Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>Three prominent scientists have also stated that the EPA should not give more weight to the 2020 AHS study than the numerous other studies done over the years.</p>

<p>In a court filing challenging the EPA’s paraquat assessment, the three scientists – including Beate Ritz, co-director of the UCLA Center for Gene-Environment Studies of Parkinson’s disease – said that numerous studies implicated paraquat as a cause for Parkinson’s.</p>

<p>Ritz has also been retained as an expert witness for plaintiffs in the litigation against Syngenta, and has written a report detailing the flaws she sees specifically in the 2020 AHS study.</p>

<p>The scientists said that the EPA had looked at 26 epidemiological studies in its assessment of paraquat and Parkinson’s and all but two of them found positive associations between the pesticide and the disease. Yet the EPA downgraded most of those studies, focusing on those that did not find an association, the scientists said. The agency similarly improperly dismissed animal studies that found an association, they wrote.</p>

<p>“EPA discounted many important epidemiological and animal studies for reasons that were not sufficiently grounded in science,” the scientists wrote. “Multiple lines of convergent scientific evidence, published in peer-reviewed journals over many years, establish a link between paraquat and Parkinson’s.”</p>

<p>Critics accuse the EPA of being inappropriately cozy with the pesticide industry, and biasing its decisions to favor companies selling pesticides. Several EPA scientists came forward last year, publicly alleging that EPA management routinely pressures EPA scientists to tamper with risk assessments of chemicals in ways that downplayed the harm the chemicals could pose. The EPA scientists provided emails, text messages, and other records to Congress that the legal group representing them says demonstrates a “rigged system”. The EPA’s office of inspector general is investigating the complaints.</p>

<p>The scientists complained, among other things, that key managers move back and forth between industry jobs and positions at the EPA. An example is seen in the recent agency review of paraquat.</p>

<p>Records show that one of the EPA officials signing off on the 2019 EPA paraquat assessment had come to the EPA from an industry position. Biologist Kristin Rickard served in 2019 as the acting branch chief for the EPA risk assessment branch evaluating paraquat. Before joining the EPA in 2009, Rickard worked for CropLife America, the powerful Washington-based lobbying organization that represents the pesticide industry.</p>

<p>The EPA did not provide a comment.</p>

<p>“One of the most impactful threats to human health from the [EPA] comes from the wide-open door between the regulators and industry,” said Nathan Donley, environmental health science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. The non-profit group is among several organizations challenging the EPA’s paraquat assessment in federal court.</p>

<p>“Croplife’s entire purpose is to get the pesticide industry whatever it wants,” Donley said. “Someone from that world should not be making decisions that have such an enormous impact on public health.”</p>

<p>Rickard now works as a senior scientific evaluator at Health Canada, and did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>In response to the court challenge of its paraquat assessment, the EPA said in late September that it would reconsider “aspects” of its decision to keep paraquat on the market, and would issue an addendum to its assessment within a year.</p>

<p>In the meantime, as they continue to push EPA to ban paraquat, some groups worried about the chemical are also moving to try to convince California to halt its use. As a major agricultural state, a ban in California would set the state for similar moves in other states, say those seeking a ban.</p>

<p>The Center for Biological Diversity said it will formally be asking the state to re-evaluate and ban paraquat ahead of the state’s upcoming annual reapproval of all pesticide ingredients in 2023.</p>

<p>Donley said decades of internal Syngenta corporate documents recently revealed in the Guardian and the New Lede support the need to halt the use of the weedkiller.</p>

<p>“We think there is a pretty compelling case to re-review paraquat because of Parkinson’s disease,” Donley said. “You have to take into account all the evidence, and when you do it paints a pretty clear picture.”</p>

<h2 id="2265841641079209054">‘Dying of boredom’: the fight to release Thailand’s shopping mall gorilla</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Holding a fist full of green beans, Bua Noi stares through the iron bars and glass of her home at the visitors busy taking pictures of Bangkok’s controversial “shopping mall gorilla”. To their dismay, the animal fondly known as King Kong soon saunters away from the viewing window, past the hanging tyre to the back of her sparse enclosure.</p>

<p>“She’s sitting there dying of boredom,” says Edwin Wiek, founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand.</p>

<p>Gorillas, which are native to Africa, are social animals that typically live in family groups. Bua Noi, which translates as Little Lotus, has lived alone for much of her 30-plus years on the seventh floor of a desolate city centre shopping complex at Thailand’s family-owned Pata Zoo.</p>

<p>The primate is at the centre of a longstanding dispute between the private rooftop zoo in Bangkok and animal rights activists around the world. In 2020, Cher joined those calling for the gorilla’s release, with the singer writing to Thailand’s environment minister, Varawut Silpa-archa, to express “deep concern” over Bua Noi’s living conditions. Gillian Anderson joined the outcry, calling for the zoo to be closed.</p>

<p>Campaigners say the animals have little stimulation and are confined in unnatural enclosures at the zoo, which is on the top floors of a department store. Bua Noi’s mate died more than a decade ago, according to the Bangkok Post.</p>

<p>Hopes were raised last week when Thailand’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment said it planned to buy and rehabilitate Bua Noi. They were soon dashed when the owners released a statement saying no talks were happening and no price had been agreed, despite mentions of 30m baht (£700,000) circulating online.</p>

<p>“Every animal at Pata Zoo is enduring a life sentence, something not handed to even the hardest Thai criminals,” says Jason Baker, senior vice president at Peta Asia. “They could have a meaningful life if they were transferred to a facility that would provide the mental stimulation and physical comfort of the naturalistic environment they need.”</p>

<p>But, in the statement, Bua Noi’s owners said the “ageing gorilla” may not adapt to a new environment with new pathogens.</p>

<p>Gorillas can live to about 40 in the wild, and longer in captivity.</p>

<p>Amos Courage at the Aspinall Foundation dismissed those concerns, and believes Bua Noi could be given great care in a sanctuary. The foundation has previously offered to cover the costs of this transition, as has Free the Wild, a charity co-founded by Cher.</p>

<p>Closer to home, Wiek says his rescue centre, which is around two hours outside Bangkok, could also take her. “Wherever she goes, as long as she gets out of that glass aquarium … that would be great,” he says.</p>

<p>Kung Chan is a 50-year-old Bangkok resident and city guide who visited Pata Zoo in May to relive a visit he’d taken in his childhood. He says he likely wouldn’t be back after what he saw. “I was not happy. We only stayed for 15 minutes … I don’t want to see [Bua Noi] in a room like that.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere around the zoo, an orangutan looks on at maintenance work, which has the concrete corridor partially cordoned off, while rusty signs and flaking walls make up the aesthetic of this ageing zoo. Flamingos roam free and monkeys reach out for food that visitors can buy on arrival.</p>

<p>Wiek says: “The bottom line is the place needs to be closed down … fundraising to get one gorilla out of that zoo by the government sounds like an ethical thing to do but it’s not. We need to look at a solution for all the animals in the zoo,”</p>

<p>Pata Zoo declined to comment beyond its statement in response to Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment. The owner of the zoo, Kanit Sermsirimongkol, has previously rejected claims that the animals are poorly treated.</p>


<h2 id="149983473881170488">Vegan activist takes Switzerland to human rights court over prison diet</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Switzerland has been challenged at the European court of human rights over a failure to provide adequate vegan diets to a prisoner and a patient at the psychiatric ward of a hospital, in a case that could lead to veganism being interpreted as a protected characteristic under the right of freedom of conscience across geographic Europe.</p>

<p>The court, which is part of the Council of Europe and not the EU, this week formally asked its member state Switzerland to respond to the two complaints that Swiss state institutions had failed to provide a totally vegan diet to two applicants while they were in prison and in a hospital psychiatric unit respectively.</p>

<p>The case centres on an unnamed Swiss animal rights activist who was arrested in November 2018 over a series of break-ins and damages to slaughterhouses, butchers shops and restaurants across western Switzerland.</p>

<p>The then 28-year-old was put into pre-trial detention at Geneva’s Champ-Dollon prison for 11 months, with the cantonal judges arguing there was a danger of repetition due to the appellant’s “lack of awareness and regrets”.</p>

<p>Within days of his incarceration, the man complained to the prison authorities that he wasn’t being provided with an adequate diet in line with his vegan convictions, and was having to sustain himself with side salads, rice or burger buns.</p>

<p>He refused a supplementary treatment of vitamin B12 – low intake of which can cause anaemia and damage to the nervous system – until the prison provided a version of non-animal origin. Nonetheless, a doctor later diagnosed the prisoner of suffering from constipation, haemorrhoids and iron deficiency.</p>

<p>A written request for a change to the diet regime was rejected by the prison, which said it had already put in place measures so that the prisoner could benefit from a diet as close as possible to his beliefs.</p>

<p>An appeal was deemed inadmissible by Switzerland’s federal court in June 2020, after which the prisoner’s lawyer took the case to the Strasbourg-based European court of human rights (ECHR), which consists of 46 judges drawn from each of the countries who signed its European convention of human rights, among them non-EU states such as the UK, Turkey, Norway or Switzerland.</p>

<p>A former patient at a Swiss psychiatric hospital unit joined the appeal, saying he, too, had been denied access to a vegan diet.</p>

<p>The Strasbourg court, which rejects about 95% of the cases submitted for its consideration, admitted the appeal.</p>

<p>In its decision made public this week, the court specifically asked the Swiss state to consider whether the Geneva prison had violated article 9 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which states that “everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion”.</p>

<p>The Swiss state now has three to four months to answer the ECHR’s questions, after which the European court is likely to clarify its position on whether the right to a vegan diet in prison and hospital is enshrined in the convention.</p>

<p>The case has a special significance in French-speaking Switzerland, where “anti-speciesism” is a significant activist movement. But a ruling by the Strasbourg court would also have far-reaching consequences for food provision in prisons and hospitals in the Council of Europe’s 46 member states, which represent about 700 million people.</p>

<p>While the right to a vegan diet in prison on religious grounds is already covered by case law in some European countries, the ECHR ruling could expand it by defining veganism as an ethical system of belief.</p>

<p>In a similar case, an Ontario firefighter in 2019 filed a complaint with the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario against his employer, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, over an insufficient provision of vegan food while battling a massive fire in British Columbia.</p>

<h2 id="1714577854313659764">Elon Musk’s Twitter is going to be a disaster | Hamilton Nolan</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Twitter is free. You can go on there and type your embarrassing little thoughts for the whole world to see any time you like. Millions of us have been doing this for years. Revealing to everyone how dumb your inner thoughts are may cost you your reputation, sure, but it won’t cost you any money. Not even if you’re the richest man in the country.</p>

<p>So why spend $44bn to buy it? That’s a fair piece of change, even to someone whose net worth hovers above $200bn. It’s also much more than the company is actually worth, as evidenced by Elon Musk’s desperate attempt to get out of the deal almost as soon as he had gotten irretrievably into it. The price is too high to be a pure lifestyle purchase – if you want a media property just for the social cachet and party invitations, it can be had much cheaper. Fellow villainous mega-billionaire space tourist Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post for a mere $250m, less than 1% of what Musk just paid for a cacophonous global collection of weird, hollering self-promotion.</p>

<p>In truth, Musk probably bought Twitter for the same reason that sickeningly rich people throughout history have become press barons: to try to control the conversation. About themselves, in particular, and secondly about their own economic interests, and thirdly about their own inevitably selfish, bizarre, half-witted political beliefs. Once you have ascended the ladder of wealth past buying real estate and cars and boats and models and the other tawdry baubles that come with money, there comes a time when a hardworking plutocrat begins to be irked by the fact that, beyond their sphere of servants, people are still talking trash about them. It upsets their sense of omnipotence. After the thrill of bending the material world to their whim has worn off, the desire to bend the public conversation – and, by extension, the public mind – to their own liking takes root.</p>

<p>This has always been a hit-and-miss proposition. It’s easiest for those who are interested in straightforward political influence. From William Randolph Hearst to Rupert Murdoch, media moguls have a well-tested playbook for using sensationalism and propaganda and fearmongering to produce political outcomes. That’s the easy stuff. When the motives get mixed, though, things get dicey for the aspiring media moguls.</p>

<p>For those who don’t have Bezos-sized wallets, owning a news outlet can be a painfully expensive way to get party invitations. For those who don’t have Murdoch’s ruthlessness, it can be a frustratingly difficult way to change the minds of readers and viewers. And for those who lack perfect clarity about what they are doing, well, the possibility for hilarious disaster is very real.</p>

<p>Elon Musk is, ironically, the exact type of person for whom Twitter is poison. Wealthy, powerful and celebrated, he could have kept his mouth shut and let his work speak for itself; instead, he uses Twitter, and reveals to all of us that the richest man in the richest nation in the history of the world is an unfunny meme guy easily seduced by the same sorts of ideas that grab the minds of Reddit-scrolling 13-year-old boys. There is a lesson there about the inability of wealth to make someone interesting – but, setting that aside, there is a more relevant lesson about the danger of vast concentrations of wealth. Because when you mix the immature, half-baked, self-righteous grandiosity of a guy like Elon Musk with the ability to buy and sell multibillion-dollar global public corporations like toys, you have a recipe for chaotic, destructive stupidity on a staggering scale.</p>

<p>Many on the left suspect that Musk is in fact a Rupert Murdoch of the tech generation, planning to use Twitter’s algorithms to disperse and promote rightwing ideas. Others say this was all a way for him to diversify his finances and sell off a ton of Tesla shares without sparking investor panic. Those tidy explanations would be more satisfying than the likely truth: this guy saw a chance to put his sophomoric ideas about “free speech” into practice on his favorite app, and he did.</p>

<p>It is as if a half-bright fantasy football player bought your favorite NFL franchise and ran it right into the ground. (Except the implications of this – intertwined as they are with politics and media and Trumpism – are much worse.) Above all, we are in for an abject demonstration of why it is bad to have random businessmen running around your society with enough money to do absolutely anything they want. As kaleidoscopic as the factions of Twitter users are, this episode should be enough to make them all unite behind the idea of a wealth tax.</p>

<p>In a message to advertisers posted the day the sale closed, Musk wrote that “The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner.” OK. Sure. Forty-four billion dollars seems like a lot to pay for the right to grandly reinstate @NaziAnime666’s right to post gifs about Pizzagate or whatever, but a fool and his money are soon parted and all that.</p>

<p>You may notice that Musk’s stated goal of being an angel of open, civilized discourse is not wholly compatible with all billionaires’ natural desire to bend the content of that discourse in a direction that they agree with. Reconciling these two competing mandates is one of the oldest and most central tasks of news media companies, or discourse-shaping social media companies, owned by rich guys. Many thoughtful journalists, pundits and professors have spent their careers wrestling with this tension – unfettered truth versus the blinkered logic of capitalism. Two hundred years into the history of American journalism, it’s still an open question how it will all be resolved.</p>

<p>But I do know one thing for sure: Elon Musk, zillionaire king of the nerds, alt-right meme lord, and committed union buster, is not the guy who’s gonna figure it out. If you are wondering what lies in store for all of us after his big purchase, just assume the dumbest possibilities will come true. An owner who is not cool or funny will do things that he thinks are cool or funny. Trouble will ensue. Tech and media are both inherently unstable industries, so the good news is that the possibility of Twitter spectacularly imploding does not make them that much different from everywhere else. Enjoy it while it lasts. Stay focused on eradicating billionaires forever. And, if you have the misfortune of working at Twitter, get yourself a union as soon as possible.

<h2 id="907097716407168314">Rishi Sunak – if you’re serious about fixing the British economy, invest in childcare | Stella Creasy</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>As the new prime minister burnishes his family man credentials, mothers this weekend are highlighting that when it comes to this government, their needs are getting the same worrying lack of attention that Bing’s friend Pando gets when he keeps taking his trousers off. With childcare costs reaching up to two-thirds of their income, women of childbearing age are leaving the workforce in their droves – meaning their taxes and their talent both go untapped. In response, campaigners are taking to the streets as part of Pregnant then Screwed’s March of the Mummies to highlight the fact that, while mothers may be surviving on a diet of Pom-Bears and strong coffee, we also have a voice and a vote, and we’re not afraid to use either.</p>

<p>The UK has the second most expensive childcare system in the world, and parental leave that may as well be called “parental lump it” because so few can actually afford to take it. We have failed to make flexible working a reality for all but the most wealthy. And the pandemic exacerbated what was already a raw deal.</p>

<p>Whether they were more likely to be furloughed than men, more likely to be made redundant – and now more likely to be stuck, unable to return to work, because there is still no affordable childcare, many mothers face bleak prospects.</p>

<p>The new prime minister’s track record does not bode well. As chancellor he was taken to court for refusing to recognise maternity leave when providing pandemic support to self-employed women. When challenged, he compared it to a holiday, ignoring the fact that it affected only women. Such blindness towards mothers wasn’t a one off. Rishi Sunak also blocked plans to make childcare funding more flexible for those on the lowest incomes because he claimed there could be more fraud.</p>

<p>The sound of mothers gnashing their teeth as the chancellor “thanked” them for “juggling work and childcare” during Covid was only drowned out by their frustration as millions were splashed on filling potholes while not a pound was offered to stop nurseries going bust.</p>

<p>Removing the barriers that prevent mothers being able to care for children and have a career goes well beyond a lack of nursery places – a sector in which 4,000 providers have gone out of business in the last year alone. Maternity benefit is just 47% of the national minimum wage, meaning increasingly women are pushed into debt or into returning to work early. The system fails fathers too. They only get two weeks’ statutory leave and are rarely encouraged to take more time off, despite evidence showing how much this benefits children. Government statistics also show that the number of men quitting work for family has gone up 15% in the past year.</p>

<p>Despite talk of the value of flexible working, and the leadership of enlightened major employers, the government has yet to make it the default, and only 10% of jobs are advertised as part-time. Other countries take a different approach and reap the rewards. The Canadian government has just invested C$30bn (£19bn) in its childcare sector to create a system that will eventually cost parents no more than C$10 (£6.40) a day. It did this because of a 2012 survey that found that for every C$1 invested in early childhood education, it got between C$1.50 and C$2.80 back in the wider economy. The economics are compelling: a 50% increase in current flexible working rates could result in the creation of 51,200 new jobs and a net economic gain of £55bn.</p>

<p>Too many in public life accept the narrative that motherhood is only done right if it’s a struggle. Consequently, mothers get shamed whatever they do: go out to work and your kids will be feral; work part-time and you’re not really committed to your employer; stay at home and you’re failing the forces of feminism. Women in all political parties report being castigated for abandoning their children if they stand for office, and the House of Commons thrives on traditions and cultures that don’t fit well with kids’ bedtimes. Westminster is a place where access to maternity leave and cover is determined not by policy but by patronage. When the place that makes the laws has such an unwelcoming approach to mothers, it has little credibility to challenge others to do better.</p>

<p>Sunak should take note of the March of the Mummies, not so that he has something nice to say next time he talks to Mumsnet or because Labour is leading the way on committing to reform, but because our economy and our society won’t thrive if we don’t end the motherhood penalty that is keeping women stuck in a nightmare. Childcare is a vital part of the national infrastructure, and those failing to invest in it are the real anti-growth coalition: there can be no solution to the cost of living crisis engulfing the UK until the problem is tackled. Mothers are putting MPs on notice they are on the move and headed towards the ballot box.

<h2 id="1413255019262918175">Northern Ireland faces another pointless election thanks to London’s Brexit mess | Fintan O’Toole</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Last week, amid all the turmoil in the Tory party, there was a brief flurry of interest in the emergence as a candidate for prime minister of the man more than one British reporter referred to as “the Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis”. Lewis was not the Northern Ireland secretary. He wasn’t even the previous holder of the office – he was the one before that.</p>

<p>Likewise, when Rishi Sunak was eventually selected, at least one distinguished British commentator proclaimed him the first person of Asian heritage to become prime minister of a European country. Actually, the first such leader was Leo Varadkar, who became taoiseach in Dublin five years ago.</p>

<p>These are minor slips, and all the easier to forgive when political events are following the vertiginous logic of a fever dream. But they do serve as a reminder that the so-called border down the Irish Sea is not just a trade barrier. There is also a haze of psychological detachment – keeping track of who’s in office in Dublin and Belfast is not, for most people in England, all that important.</p>

<p>Thus, when the actual Northern Ireland secretary, Chris Heaton-Harris (the seventh since the Brexit referendum), announced on Friday that he is calling a new election for the devolved assembly, his decision scarcely registered above zero on the Richter scale at Westminster. Small earthquake in Belfast – not many dead. Who really cares that the election will fit precisely Ambrose Bierce’s definition of a road as the path “along which one may pass from where it is too tiresome to be to where it is futile to go”?</p>

<p>The politics of Northern Ireland are tiresome enough without this exercise in electoral futility. No one expects the outcome to be significantly different to that of the assembly elections last May. No one believes that the Democratic Unionist party will have any incentive, in the tribal atmosphere of a new election, to soften its insistence that it will not allow the assembly to function or an executive to be formed until the Northern Ireland protocol of the Brexit withdrawal agreement is scrapped. Unless something else happens, they will all be back again in the same frigid halls of Stormont, bedecked perhaps with boughs of holly, but with no Christmas cheer to lighten the political gloom.</p>

<p>Perhaps, then, there really is no reason why anyone on the eastern shores of the Irish Sea should be bothered by it all. Except that the very pointlessness of the election does make a bigger point. For what is going on in this theatre of the absurd is another episode of the Brexit show. The collapse of Northern Ireland’s political institutions, and the breakdown of the internal arrangements envisaged in the Good Friday agreement, are predictable consequences of the DUP’s crazy zeal for a hard Brexit.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland has often been the place where the detritus of British politics – old sectarian attitudes, old colonial habits of mind – washes up and lingers. This is now happening again with Brexit. The great revolution of 2016 has become almost unspeakable in British politics. Boris Johnson’s boosterish babble is silenced; Keir Starmer has excised the B-word from his vocabulary. There is a deep desire not to talk about it. But Northern Ireland is where its political effects are unavoidable.</p>

<p>At the heart of the political crisis in Northern Ireland is the DUP’s inability to take responsibility for the effects of its passionate embrace of the Brexit ultras in London. For the DUP gave birth to the protocol. Its horror is repugnance at the face of its own child. It is this weird reality that makes Northern Ireland currently ungovernable under the arrangements agreed in 1998.</p>

<p>There were – and still are – only three ways to deal with the consequences of Northern Ireland being forced, against the will of its people, out of the EU. One is a hard border on the island of Ireland, which is unacceptable. The second is what Theresa May ended up with in the infamous “backstop” – all of the UK would in effect remain in the single market and the customs union, thus avoiding the emergence of different trading regimes on the two sides of the Irish Sea. The DUP got this outcome from May. The party rewarded her by helping to bring her down and put Boris Johnson in power.</p>

<p>Because of this insanity, there was only one remaining possibility: a so-called border down the Irish Sea. The DUP hates it – and, from a unionist perspective, it is quite right to do so. But by helping to bring down May, it made it entirely inevitable. This, of course, it can never admit. It is left to rail against its own creation and to use the only power it now has, which is to paralyse politics in Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>Instead of calling a patently purposeless election, the British government has to face its own responsibilities in all of this. By threatening to tear up the protocol, and hence resile from the withdrawal agreement, it has merely encouraged the DUP to believe that its historic error can be wished away. It is, in effect, suggesting that the unfortunate people of Northern Ireland can solve the mess of Brexit by voting in a useless election.</p>

<p>They can’t. But Rishi Sunak can – if he faces down the Brexit ultras, recommits himself to obeying international law, and engages in proper negotiations with the EU to make the protocol work better. It is the first test of whether he can begin to make Britain a serious country again.

<h2 id="623459063327051610">Sunak is the best choice the Tories could have made – but Labour can still beat him | Jonathan Freedland</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Publicly, they said they feared no one. When Labour MPs were asked a week ago which of the three would-be successors to Liz Truss looked hardest to defeat, they shrugged off the question, insisting that Boris Johnson, Penny Mordaunt and Rishi Sunak were all as weak and beatable as each other. But whatever the outward show, the truth is Labour got the Conservative leader that, at first glance, they had good reason to dread.</p>

<p>The evidence has been swift. On Thursday a poll showed that Sunak is more trusted on the economy, as well as on taxes and business, than Keir Starmer. When asked who they’d prefer as prime minister, it was close, but more voters went for Sunak. Never mind that the survey had Labour comfortably ahead of the Conservatives overall: the economy and leadership are reliably the two key determinants of general elections – and on both measures Sunak has the edge.</p>

<p>His debut at prime minister’s questions would have settled few Labour nerves. He was fluent and, admittedly after the bar was set low-to-subterranean by Truss, he conveys a basic competence, able to match Starmer’s defining offer to the electorate of a safe pair of hands. Only the most deluded partisan would deny Sunak is smart, with the obvious advantage that he is at least an associate member of the reality-based community – a fact vividly demonstrated during his summer campaign against Truss, when he regularly reminded his rival of the laws of economic gravity, only to watch as she crashed to Earth precisely as he had predicted. And though it has brought far less attention, still less resistance, than US satirists might have you believe, the fact that Sunak is the first British-Asian prime minister is not only a historic milestone but also a reminder of one of Labour’s enduring weaknesses: the party’s elected leaders have only ever been white men.</p>

<p>All of that will trouble Labour supporters who could soon be looking back fondly to the 44-day Truss era and its gargantuan poll leads. They dared to dream that those numbers would hold up if either of Sunak’s presumed challengers won the top job: Mordaunt would have been another Truss, while Johnson carried more baggage than a carousel at Terminal 5. Instead, by uniting around Sunak, the Tories look like an opponent that might just be getting its act together.</p>

<p>On one level, that’s true: given who they are, and the position they are in, Tory MPs made the best, most rational choice they could. But there are at least five reasons why none of that should induce panic in those who want to see a Labour government both win power and succeed.</p>

<p>First, it’s clear that however flattering the contrast between Sunak and his immediate predecessor – and Starmer did well to note that, in his only competitive election, the new prime minister was “trounced by someone who was then beaten by a lettuce” – Sunak himself has weaknesses aplenty. His re-appointment of Suella Braverman, after a wilderness period that lasted all of six days, is an early stain that threatens to spread, as more detail emerges of the recklessly casual, and rule-breaking, attitude to information-sharing demonstrated by the woman charged with overseeing those who guard the nation’s secrets. Defenders will say he had to bring Braverman back, to keep the right on board and in return for her endorsement. But the same cannot be said of the return of Gavin Williamson, the first man to be awarded a knighthood for services to mediocrity. In his bid for team-of-rivals unity, Sunak has foregone the opportunity for a fresh start and assembled a government packed with faces wearily familiar from the shaming days of both Johnson and Truss.</p>

<p>Sunak has personal vulnerabilities too. Labour has no need to remind voters of Sunak’s vast wealth – which would allow its critics to brand the party anti-aspiration – because they can let others do that. But they can press him on non-dom status, which deprives the national coffers of £3.2bn a year and from which the Sunak household benefited directly until public exposure made the arrangement untenable. An even riper bruise to punch is Sunak’s summer boast to Tory activists that he had diverted funds from deprived communities to ensure leafy areas like theirs got leafier. Used adroitly, those few seconds of video should render hollow any promises the new PM makes on levelling up or protecting the most vulnerable.</p>

<p>There’s scope too to cast Sunak as a man of slick presentation but of appalling judgment. He should not be allowed to forget the folly of “eat out to help out” and, on a rather graver scale, his decision, in the very week that the UN warned that the world is failing to act in the face of a climate catastrophe, not to attend the Cop summit that may be a last chance to limit the havoc. Tories like to say they got the big calls right, but they got the biggest call of recent British political history – Brexit – dead wrong. It’s easy to forget, with his remainer vibes, but Sunak was an eager enthusiast for that act of economic and cultural self-harm.</p>

<p>Second, there is much to ensure the bloom falls off the Sunak rose pretty fast. On 17 November, he and the chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, are set to impose a new round of austerity and, no matter how strenuously they insist that they are responding to global pressures, the voters know that the hole in the public finances was made wider and deeper by the Conservative government, thanks to the Truss-Kwarteng mini-budget. This won’t be like the austerity of a decade ago, which followed a decade of Labour investment. These cuts will pare already-stripped services to the bone. Witness the hospital waiting list for England that now stands at 6.8 million people, or the record numbers of people waiting more than 12 hours to get seen in A&E. And that’s before winter bites.</p>

<p>Third, Labour can take some comfort that it falls to Sunak and Hunt to clean up the mess left by their immediate predecessors. Had Johnson or Mordaunt taken over, there’s every chance they’d have made things worse – before handing the mop to an incoming Labour government.</p>

<p>Indeed, and this is a fourth argument against panic, it might actually be better for Labour if Sunak succeeds. Recall the Labour landslide of 1997, which came after a four-year economic recovery following the Tory disaster of Black Wednesday. That suggests not only that Britons are capable of inflicting delayed punishment on a government for an economic calamity that took place several years earlier, but that they tend to feel readier to turn to Labour when there is relative calm.</p>

<p>Finally, Labour supporters are also citizens. They should not want the country to be the smoking ruin it was becoming under Truss – the currency tanking, debts rising – just because that would hasten a Labour victory. If Sunak represents the least insane route the Conservatives could have taken, that should be a source of relief rather than alarm. By now Labour should be confident enough to think beyond merely reaching the summit – looking instead to the scale of the task they will face when they get there.

<h2 id="2062354883171881318">People are going spare about Prince Harry’s memoir. Just don’t ask them why | Marina Hyde</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The interior designer and social commentator Nicky Haslam has just released the latest annual version of his fabled tea towel, on which he lists some more of the things that he “finds common”. (This year’s entries include Bond Street, coriander, divorce, porn, Stanley Johnson, hydrangeas, foundations and side plates.) Far be it from any of us to suggest culprits for the next one, but I do think “being angry with Meghan and Harry” should be a contender. Let’s be honest: there really isn’t much more desperately naff than allowing oneself to be conversationally infuriated by the commercial behaviour/comings-and-goings/mere existence of “the Sussexes”. It is hugely infra dig.</p>

<p>And yet the couple continue to drive swathes of people quite mad. For a huge throng of the vicariously enraged, this week’s release of the cover of Harry’s forthcoming memoir has once again proved a ticket to near-apoplexy. The book is to be called Spare – a hilarious and brilliant title, despite kneejerk criticism of it from people whose own books are called perfectly gopping things like “Diana’s Babies: Kate, William and the repair of a broken family”. Given Spare isn’t out till January, we’ve no idea yet of the quality of its content, though I note Harry has benefited from Andre Agassi’s ghostwriter. So we could be in for more unforgettable and award-winning sections on hair loss in the public eye.</p>

<p>We hardly need to recap the backstory with the duke and duchess, but for the sake of form let’s go once more round the houses/palaces /mock-Mediterranean Montecito mansions: Harry and his wife were made so clearly and understandably miserable by royal life that they resigned from it, and have since become a pair of frequently unbearable Californian wellness bores wafting round the same ghastly smalltown farmers’ market as Gwyneth Paltrow. Hey – it’s a living. I’m sure we’d all cross the street to avoid having a pint of improving green juice with any of them. But ultimately, so what? If the Sussexes wish to continue living their life as a lucrative soap opera – and you surely wouldn’t be publishing yet another version of “your truth” in book form if you didn’t – then it isn’t really the worst thing in the world, except arguably for certain members of their families who their haters don’t know socially.</p>

<p>Quite why Harry can’t simply be shunted into the “annoying, but amusing” category that Gwyneth herself has long occupied is unclear, even if he hasn’t yet suggested past lives therapy or popping the Koh-i-noor diamond up your fanny. Instead, the Sussexes draw more online and offline ire than homicidal and genocidal dictators. This feels somehow … uncool, on the part of the irate.</p>

<p>Perhaps, like me, you can’t quite work out in whose service the extreme anger at Harry’s every move is now unleashed. It supposedly used to be on unbidden behalf of Queen Elizabeth II, but now she is “sadly passed” (a phrase which also features on the Haslam drying-up cloth this year), it’s hard to decide for whom all this category-5 curtain-twitching fury is occurring. Is it for King Charles, who graspingly accepted literal suitcases of charity cash from a former Qatari prime minister, with one such holdall containing more than a million euros? The new sovereign also gratefully received – against all advice – a £1m payment from a member of the Bin Laden family. Yes, perhaps it is on Charles’s behalf that people are against anything that feels like an absolute pisstake by someone who is already beyond super-rich.</p>

<p>Either way, one does start to drift off a bit when people suggest the Sussexes are not very talented and should not have this path to vast unearned wealth. Perhaps not. But life isn’t fair. Most importantly, can royalists ever really get into the deserved-riches argument? The British royal family’s stupidity has been internationally reputed since at least George I. In an actual meritocracy they’d probably be unemployable, or podcasters. Instead they cut ribbons several days a week and lead an obviously straitjacketed existence of public duty, in return for living like kings. Sorry – living as kings. I can’t help feeling that those who are more angry than anything at Harry and Meghan’s pathway to vast unearned wealth are so close to understanding why they’re really angry – and yet, still so far away.

<h2 id="1538904724948259422">The cult of Putin in Serbia reflects a nation that has still not dealt with its past</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>“Ukraine attacks Russia!” was the surreal headline on a report in the 22 February edition of Informer, Serbia’s biggest-selling tabloid. That headline was not a one off, it was an expression of the Putinophilia that has been strong in Serbia for years. As most of the world condemned Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, much of the media in Serbia turned to glorification of Russia’s actions. Tabloids, web portals, dailies, weeklies and nationwide television channels celebrated the destruction of Ukrainian cities and gave wholehearted support to Russian armed forces. The killing of civilians, the levelling of cities and the destruction of cultural monuments appeared to fill some of Serbia’s editors with enthusiasm and exuberance.</p>

<p>Pro-Russia rallies took place in Belgrade, at which the crowd cheered Putin and the letter Z was scrawled on the asphalt. The rest of the world shuddered as it watched real-time coverage of corpses on the streets of Bucha, civilians sheltering from Russian shells in underground stations and millions of refugees fleeing their country, but instead of compassionfor innocent victims, understanding for the criminals seemed the response of Putin’s Serbian fans.</p>

<p>If President Aleksandar Vučić’s allies in the Serb media appear sanguine about death and destruction in Ukraine, he claims that the country is politically neutral. Serbia has grudgingly voted in favour of the UN general assembly’s resolutions condemning Russia’s use of forceand illegal annexation of Ukrainian territory. But the Vučić government has repeatedly refused to back western sanctions against Russia. European officials, US senators and various envoys have flocked to Vučić, telling him that it was time to choose: would Serbia be part of Europe or an ally of Russia? Despite all the pressure, Vučić keeps Serbia in limbo.</p>

<p>But there can be no neutrality when it comes to Russia’s campaign against Ukraine. To remain neutral while an executioner butchers a victim means morally siding with the executioner.</p>

<p>Serbia’s attitude towards the war in Ukraine requires additional context. Whereas in other countries, the Russian state-owned news agency, Sputnik, and the Russian TV channel RT diffuse the Kremlin’s propaganda, in Serbia most of the domestic media act as if they themselves are part of the Russian machinery under the command of the Kremlin’s communications supervisors. The problem is not limited to the media. Serbia has never renounced the Greater Serbia nationalist ideology that led to the wars of the former Yugoslavia. The one exception was the short premiership of Zoran Đinđić, but that was cut short by his assassination in 2003 .</p>

<p>Today’s Serb political leaders were participants in the wars of the 1990s. Vučić was a high-ranking official of the Serbian Radical party of convicted war criminal Vojislav Šešelj. His coalition partner Ivica Dačić, leader of the Socialist party of Serbia, was Slobodan Milošević’s spokesman. One of Vučić’s closest associates, the minister of the interior, Aleksandar Vulin, began his career as a functionary of the Yugoslav Left, the party founded by Milošević’s late wife, Mirjana Marković. Today’s minister for European integration, Jadranka Joksimović, worked on the Serbian Radical party’s magazine, Velika Srbija, whose title (Greater Serbia) speaks for itself.</p>

<p>Serbian political leaders still don’t publicly acknowledge Srebrenica as genocide. If at all, they refer to the “terrible crimes” committed. But there has been no dealing with the past at the state level. On the contrary, political, media, cultural, church and social elites continue to deny Serbian responsibility for war crimes. Serbia’s recent historical revisionism suggests that it was Serbs who were the victims , never the criminals. Internationally convicted Serb war criminals return home after serving their sentences and given heroes’ welcomes, sinecures and media space to expound their version of the truth, which The Hague tribunal was of course, unable to understand.</p>

<p>Murals sport the image of Ratko Mladić often with the slogan “Serbian hero” in cities all over Serbia. Anyone who speaks about Serbian crimes is smeared as a traitor by a media lynch mob. At the Serbian war crimes prosecutor’s office, 2,500 cases have been languishing at the pre-trial investigation stage for years. According to estimates by the Humanitarian Law Center in Belgrade, at least 6,000 unconvicted war criminals freely walk the streets of Serbian cities.</p>

<p>For far-right Serb nationalists, the current state of peace in the Balkans is temporary, just like the borders. They still dream of a great Serbian state that will encompass Kosovo, Montenegro, Republika Srpska and parts of Croatia. The realisation of that dream is not possible as things stand, but the nationalists are patient. After defeat in the Yugoslav wars, they retreated to lick their wounds, fuel hatred towards their neighbours and keep the population in a state of combat-readiness via the media. That they must bide their time until international circumstances change has been one of the main narratives of Russian propaganda for the Serbian market filtered through parts of the Serb media for more than two decades.</p>

<p>Serb ultra-nationalists have waited for Russia to enter into a decisive conflict with the western antichrist, to defeat godless Europe and the USand to establish a different world order. They have placed their faith in Putin as a messiah and imagine him as an upgraded version of Slobodan Milošević: the ruler of a powerful empire with a nuclear arsenal at his disposal.</p>

<p>When Russia invaded Ukraine, Putin’s followers here thought their hour had come; this was the beginning of the great upheaval in which the old order would be razed and from its ruins a world would arise where sovereignty, borders and international treaties were of no import. Instead of international law and other western trifles, the law of the jungle would prevail, as authoritarian tradition dictates. States such as Serbia, favoured by the world’s ruler enthroned in the Kremlin would gain the right to finish what they started three decades ago to finally create the enlarged state for which they have been longing for centuries, to fit their own imagined grandeur.</p>

<p>Lauding Russia’s criminal aggression against a sovereign country may seem strange to the uninformed. But for those of us who live in the heart of darkness, a country whose heroes are Slobodan Milošević, Radovan Karadžić and Ratko Mladić, we expect nothing better. Those who still believe conspiracy theories about the 1994 massacre in Sarajevo’s Markale that it was staged and the dismembered corpses were actually dummies, will easily believe similar propaganda about the massacres of civilians in Bucha. If media hyenas can deride the victims of the Srebrenica genocide on primetime TV, why would they grieve for the victims of Putin’s crimes? As the great Serbian writer and thinker Radomir Konstantinović said in 1991: “We live in a world (if this is living) in which the monstrous is coming to be natural, and the natural monstrous.” His diagnosis of Serbia has, unfortunately, lost none of its accuracy.

<h2 id="2034862436217781922">Disney introduces first plus-size heroine in animated short Reflect</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Disney has debuted its first plus-size female protagonist in a short film that is being praised for exploring body positivity and overcoming self-doubt.</p>

<p>The animation, Reflect, tells the story of Bianca, a young ballet dancer who “battles her own reflection, overcoming doubt and fear by channelling her inner strength, grace and power”.</p>

<p>It forms part of Disney’s Short Circuit series of experimental films, released over the Disney+ streaming service last month.</p>

<p>The six-minute feature has been pitched as an uplifting tale of conquering body dysmorphia and self-doubt.</p>

<p>The Disney animation artist and director Hillary Bradfield, who also worked on Encanto and Frozen II, said she hoped viewers could “feel more positively about themselves and how they look” after watching the short.</p>

<p>“Sometimes you go to the dark place to get to the good place. And that just makes the good place that much more beautiful,” she said in an interview before the film’s release.</p>

<p>In a clip released by Disney over social media, Bianca is seen practising ballet in front of a mirror as the reflected image begins to break apart. Struggling with her confidence, she eventually finds her feet and dances until the mirror fades away.</p>

<p>“This is very encouraging and I am glad Disney decided to include a ‘plus-sized’ heroine,” one person tweeted.</p>

<p>“I wish I could have seen this when I was younger! But so happy things are changing!” another said.</p>

<p>Others had reservations. Adam Bray, the author of the Marvel Studios Visual Dictionary, said the film “isn’t long enough to parse nuances of the message”.</p>

<p>Disney has more recently sought to reframe its public image, releasing more content featuring diverse characters and addressing its historical racism and sexism.</p>

<p>In 2020, the company introduced its Stories Matter initiative, pledging to be more inclusive and consultative, and acknowledging Disney’s responsibility to “consciously, purposefully and relentlessly champion the spectrum of voices and perspectives in our world”.</p>


<h2 id="2285266472364814989">Cocktail of the week: Salvatore Calabrese’s Amalfi dream – recipe | The good mixer</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I came up with this at a friend’s house in Amalfi in the south-west of Italy, when I was asked to whip up a quick pre-dinner drink. Unfortunately, there was nothing in the cupboard bar a bottle of vodka and some liquore di limone, but thankfully there were lemons and herbs in the garden, too, and so this drink was born. Liquore di limone is essentially the rock star of limoncello and very high-grade, though, weirdly, it tends to be produced in France. In the same spirit of spontaneity with which this drink came about, feel free to use limoncello instead, so long as it’s one made with real Amalfi lemons – Villa Massa and Pallini are two of my favourites.</p>

<p>50ml vodka</p>

<p>20ml liquore di limone, or limoncello (see introduction)</p>

<p>20ml freshly squeezed lemon juice (from Amalfi lemons, ideally, when in season)</p>

<p>3-4 mint leaves, plus 1 sprig extra to garnish</p>

<p>1 lemon slice, to garnish</p>

<p>This couldn’t be easier, or more refreshing: simply put all the liquids and the mint leaves in a shaker, fill with ice and shake hard to bruise and break up the mint. Strain into an old fashioned glass filled with fresh ice, garnish and serve.</p>


<h2 id="1498478855591422114">Experience: I paddled a giant pumpkin down a river for 11 hours</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I’ve always had a knack for growing big fruit and vegetables, and my tomatoes, squashes and peppers regularly win prizes at the Otoe County Fair near my home in Syracuse, Nebraska.</p>

<p>The one thing I struggled with was pumpkins. For the first few years, mine never quite took off. Gradually, I started to get more impressive results. But it wasn’t until I attended a pumpkin-growing seminar six years ago in Portland, Oregon, that my interest developed into an obsession.</p>

<p>I got talking to a woman called Charity who held the world record for the longest river journey by pumpkin boat. I’d never heard of anyone paddling in a pumpkin before, but once the idea was in my head, I had to try it. Within a few weeks, Charity’s 15.09-mile record was beaten by a man in Minnesota who completed a 25.5-mile voyage. If there’s one thing I’ve never lacked, it’s optimism, and I decided that with the right pumpkin, I could do better.</p>

<p>I spent thousands of dollars on mega-pumpkin seeds. After a few years, I was regularly turning out specimens of 400lb (181kg) or more – I’d give them to neighbours for Halloween. But the pumpkins that had won the river-paddling records were more than twice that size.</p>

<p>This year I noticed one particular specimen of the Atlantic Giant variety was overtaking the others. My wife called her Berta, and we watched with excitement over the next few weeks as Berta put on 12 to 15lb a day. I finally cut her off when she reached 846lb. It was a tough call, but I wanted her to be big enough for me to fit inside, but still reasonably snug – I knew it was going to be cold when I was out on the river.</p>

<p>First, I had to test Berta on water. Using a forklift, I lowered her into a pond to see how she was going to float, marked the water level and then cut her open with an electric handsaw. I didn’t scoop out as much as you might think – a couple of five-gallon buckets’ worth. Her sides were 10in thick in places.</p>

<p>On 27 August this year, right after my 60th birthday, we set out early for the Missouri River with Berta strapped to a mattress on the back of a truck. I had a canoe paddle and was wearing a lifejacket. Berta was eased into the river and I carefully climbed in. It was like sitting in a giant, hollowed-out cork – every move I made caused Berta to tilt, so I had to lean the other way to get her back on an even keel.</p>

<p>My main task was to keep the pumpkin upright, steady on the bends and away from obstacles. There are markers every mile along the river, so it was easy for the crew of the rescue boat following me – my wife, Allyson, my sister Yvonne and my son Colton – to keep track of how far I’d gone.</p>

<p>Much of the trip passed uneventfully, but there were occasional hazards – an unexpected rock, a sandbar that I almost became trapped on and passing boats. I think some boats had come out looking for me as word started to get around, and I just had to stay calm and ride out the waves they made. I passed campers who would say hello. One guy shouted, “I’ve been living here a long time, and I’ve never seen anyone float by in a pumpkin before!”</p>

<p>It took me more than seven hours to reach the 25.5-mile point. There were whoops from the rescue boat as I confirmed the distance on my phone’s GPS. I’d already decided to keep going as far as Nebraska City if I could – another 12 miles downstream. That last stretch was the toughest – I was starting to tire and there were spells of unexpected rain. But four hours later I saw the marina up ahead, where a cheering crowd was waiting to greet me. As I paddled up, I was handed a very welcome beer.</p>

<p>I’m waiting to hear if my near 38-mile voyage is an official record. Meanwhile, Berta has been consigned to my compost heap. Every time I go by there I see parts of her and say hi. I kept all her seeds, of course.</p>

<p>My knees ached for days after the trip and at first I swore my pumpkin-paddling days were over. My daughter Morgan has different ideas, though. She wants me to grow a pumpkin big enough for the two of us to paddle down the river together, so that’s what I’m working on now. I reckon it’ll need to weigh about a ton. Can I do it? I think so. Like I said, I’m an optimist.</p>

<h2 id="2142170161340134620">Jerry Lee Lewis obituary</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Jerry Lee Lewis, who has died aged 87, achieved dazzling early success as a defining hero of rock’n’roll, when he muscled in among Elvis Presley, Little Richard and Chuck Berry, creating rock’n’roll piano from honky-tonk and hymn, as if doing so were as natural as breathing, and commandeering rhythm and blues with a casual authority achieved by no other white performer except Presley. With Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On, Great Balls of Fire and High School Confidential, he made three of the genre’s indispensable classics.</p>

<p>These hits, plus unbeatable versions of Mean Woman Blues, Berry’s Little Queenie and many more, shared an immediately identifiable style, an alchemy of the “Sun Studio sound”, fluid vocal brio and a pounding yet lyrical piano. Both hands were crucial in his playing, his striding left hand the foundation of the rhythm, even with a bass guitarist behind him.</p>

<p>Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On was his second single. Widely banned for lewdness, it sold poorly until Lewis shook up Steve Allen’s national TV show in July 1957, after which he was a star, undertaking nationwide tours while the record sold more than a million. The glorious Great Balls of Fire followed, then Breathless and the title song of the film High School Confidential, in which Lewis performed. All stormed the pop, country and R&B charts.</p>

<p>However, it was all to change in May 1958 when Lewis arrived in Britain. The press discovered that the 13-year-old girl with him was his wife of five months, Myra Gale Brown (who was also his third cousin). His tour was cancelled, Lewis was deported and his career under threat. Jerry confessed his whole hillbilly history: “I was a bigamist at 16 … My wife Myra and I are very happy.” The public were not.</p>

<p>Born in Ferriday, Louisiana, to Mary Ethel, who spoke in tongues, and Elmo Lewis, a labourer, Jerry had two sisters, Frankie Jean and Linda Gail. His elder brother, Elmo Jr, was killed by a drunk driver when they were boys. His father, imprisoned for bootlegging, was brought to the funeral in chains.</p>

<p>Jerry was raised in the Pentecostal church, on family gospel singing and country music by Jimmie Rodgers, Gene Autry, Hank Williams and the state’s singing governor, Jimmie Davis. He taught himself the guitar, drums and fiddle as well as the piano, and hung around a local club, Haney’s, where he claimed he heard top black performers from Duke Ellington to Muddy Waters.</p>

<p>At 12 he made his first paid appearance, moved on to Radio WNAT in Natchez, Mississippi, and at 13 played clubs there, while his cousin Betty Jo Slamper taught him to “smooch”.</p>

<p>Hired as a pianist by a travelling preacher, in February 1952 Lewis married the preacher’s 16-year-old daughter, Dorothy Barton. Jerry Lee, too, was 16. The following year he attended the Pentecostal Bible Institute in Waxahatchie, Texas. Expelled for playing gospel music “like coloured people”, he told them, rightly, that they “might as well accept it, ’cause some day that’s how it’s gonna be”. Back home in September 1953, a month before his divorce from Barton was finalised, he bigamously married a pregnant Jane Mitchum after three days’ jail for store-breaking and stealing a gun. Whether or not this second marriage was ever legalised, it ended in 1957.</p>

<p>In Shreveport he made two country music demos, and in Nashville sought work from Slim Whitman. But rock’n’roll was erupting across the south, and like others drawn to Sun Studios, Memphis, by Presley’s success, Lewis auditioned there. In December 1956 Sun issued Crazy Arms, which sold well despite Ray Price’s version having long been on the charts and despite Lewis sounding almost diffident (not something that would recur). The B-side, End of the Road, one of Lewis’s few compositions, was an authentic dark howl, a perfect expression of its name and place.</p>

<p>At year’s end Lewis played on the sessions for several other artists’ rockabilly cuts, among them Carl Perkins’s Matchbox and Billy Lee Riley’s Flyin’ Saucers Rock’n’Roll. Days later, Roy Orbison asked him to play. Lewis replied: “I don’t do sessions any more.” Later, pressed by a discographer as to who had played on Jerry Lee’s own records, he would offer one of the all-time great ripostes to the collector mentality: “I played on ’em: what the hell else d’you need to know?”</p>

<p>Live, he was an explosive performer in the early years, genuinely close to the edge. And uninhibitedly competitive. Resenting lower billing than Berry on a date at the Paramount Theater, Brooklyn, New York, in 1958, the rumour is that Lewis ended his act by setting the piano on fire. As they met in the wings, Lewis challenged Berry: “Follow that!” Whether or not it happened, it is a rumour Lewis himself perpetuated with glee.</p>

<p>Two 1964 live recordings show his genius. On a tawdry, humdrum date at the Star Club, Hamburg, playing to what sounds like about 50 people, and using, in the tradition of visiting American stars, an English backing group he met mere minutes before showtime, Lewis suddenly rose to a transcendent Your Cheating Heart, with exquisite vocal phrasing and unsurpassable piano, coursing with understatement and grace. In front of an audience of 50,000 in Birmingham, Alabama, he threw down a Hi-Heel Sneakers of shuddering, majestic excitement, stealing the song from all previous occupants.</p>

<p>Following his rise and fall, Lewis remained at Sun, its heaviest star, making rock’n’roll A-sides and wonderful country B-sides of the immaculate Hank Williams kind, years before country became an established new career for ex-rockers. Lewis would be a main player in opening up this route.</p>

<p>He regained the UK Top 10 once, in 1961, with a superb version of Ray Charles’s What’d I Say, its sumptuous thunder Sun Records’s last golden moment. Lewis left in 1962.</p>

<p>On record he lost direction for a time, but toured with an arrogance burnished into art, wilfully infuriating audiences of Teds by dwelling on slow country songs while provoking country crowds with unabashed rock’n’roll. In mid-song he would order a musician to “Play it, son!” only to prevent his doing so with a piano solo no one would interrupt.</p>

<p>For a while he joined the rock festivals circuit, including appearing at the 1969 Toronto Rock and Roll Revival, but by the 1970s he had cracked the mainstream country market with a succession of hits such as What’s Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me) and the impeccably wily She Still Comes Around (to Love What’s Left of Me). A rangey, muttering Me and Bobby McGee in 1971 was made “to show that damn woman [Janis Joplin] how it should be done”.</p>

<p>Ten years later, his skin waxy and his gait old, he combed his greased hair for the Wembley Country festival crowd, put on filthy sunglasses and delivered a consummate Over the Rainbow: the mic still placed to show off how stylishly his right hand could steer around it, his vocal control sublime. He continued to switch between the two genres for the rest of his career and, as late as October 2009, Lewis opened the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th anniversary concert at Madison Square Garden in New York.</p>

<p>He proclaimed himself for ever a rock’n’roller, through his remaining decades of turmoil, lurid tragedy and farce. His son with Myra, Steve, drowned in their swimming pool in 1962 aged three; one of his two sons with Jane Mitchum, Jerry Lee Jr, died in a car crash at 19 in 1973; Myra divorced him, citing mental cruelty and physical abuse; in 1983 his fifth wife, Shawn Stevens, took a fatal overdose 10 weeks into their marriage, a year after his fourth wife, Jaren Pate, drowned in another swimming pool. Rolling Stone published The Strange and Mysterious Death of Mrs Jerry Lee Lewis, accusing him of murdering one wife and abusing and/or hounding to death several others.</p>

<p>In 1975 his plane was seized with cocaine and 11 kinds of amphetamine on board; in 1976 he was arrested outside the gates of Graceland, drunk in possession of a gun; the IRS seized his property in 1979 and 1983, and he filed for bankruptcy even as Dennis Quaid was making the 1989 Hollywood film of his life, Great Balls of Fire! A short, tax-avoiding emigration to Ireland with his sixth wife, Kerrie McCarver, and their young son, Jerry Lee Lewis III, followed in 1992.</p>

<p>The marriage to Kerrie, remarkably, lasted 21 years, from 1984 to 2005; in 2012 he married for the seventh time, to his former “caregiver”, Judith Brown. There had been decades of medical catastrophe, including a collapsed lung, gall-bladder removal, bleeding stomach ulcers, spinal surgery and car-crash injuries. In 1984 he was twice brought back to life in an ambulance, and had half his stomach removed in 1985, a year his wife said he also spent shooting up methadone, tranquillisers and speed. In old age he also suffered from arthritis, pneumonia and shingles, in Rick Bragg’s 2014 book Jerry Lee Lewis: His Story.</p>

<p>Lewis embodied pinched obduracy, brooding, malevolent ignorance, violent unreliability and borderline madness. He abused women, played with guns and shot at men; he drove the highways of the south blind drunk with his loaded pistol on the dashboard. Yet in the vivid contrast between the meanness of the man and the grandeur of the artist, the common denominators were his phenomenal energy and admirable, all-conquering self-belief.</p>

<p>He will be remembered for his lifetime of hillbilly delirium, but he will be renowned for his seizure of the musical moment at the dawn of rock’n’roll, when an incomparable talent was his intoxicant and ours: when he shot up the old order and played out his defiant dramas on the keyboard, in the studio and on the stage.</p>

<h2 id="2202116984647413821">Climate crisis: UN finds ‘no credible pathway to 1.5C in place’</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>There is “no credible pathway to 1.5C in place”, the UN’s environment agency has said, and the failure to reduce carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a “rapid transformation of societies”.</p>

<p>The UN environment report analysed the gap between the CO cuts pledged by countries and the cuts needed to limit any rise in global temperature to 1.5C, the internationally agreed target. Progress has been “woefully inadequate” it concluded.</p>

<p>Current pledges for action by 2030, if delivered in full, would mean a rise in global heating of about 2.5C and catastrophic extreme weather around the world. A rise of 1C to date has caused climate disasters in locations from Pakistan to Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>If the long-term pledges by countries to hit net zero emissions by 2050 were delivered, global temperature would rise by 1.8C. But the glacial pace of action means meeting even this temperature limit was not credible, the UN report said.</p>

<p>Countries agreed at the Cop26 climate summit a year ago to increase their pledges. But with Cop27 looming, only a couple of dozen have done so and the new pledges would shave just 1% off emissions in 2030. Global emissions must fall by almost 50% by that date to keep the 1.5C target alive.</p>

<p>Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), said: “This report tells us in cold scientific terms what nature has been telling us all year through deadly floods, storms and raging fires: we have to stop filling our atmosphere with greenhouse gases, and stop doing it fast.</p>

<p>“We had our chance to make incremental changes, but that time is over. Only a root-and-branch transformation of our economies and societies can save us from accelerating climate disaster.</p>

<p>“It is a tall, and some would say impossible, order to reform the global economy and almost halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, but we must try,” she said. “Every fraction of a degree matters: to vulnerable communities, to ecosystems, and to every one of us.”</p>

<p>Andersen said action would also bring cleaner air, green jobs and access to electricity for millions.</p>

<p>The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said: “Emissions remain at dangerous and record highs and are still rising. We must close the emissions gap before climate catastrophe closes in on us all.”</p>

<p>Prof David King, a former UK chief scientific adviser, said: “The report is a dire warning to all countries – none of whom are doing anywhere near enough to manage the climate emergency.”</p>

<p>The report found that existing carbon-cutting policies would cause 2.8C of warming, while pledged policies cut this to 2.6C. Further pledges, dependent on funding flowing from richer to poorer countries, cut this again to 2.4C.</p>

<p>New reports from the International Energy Agency and the UN’s climate body reached similarly stark conclusions, with the latter finding that the national pledges barely cut projected emissions in 2030 at all, compared with 2019 levels.</p>

<p>The UNEP report said the required societal transformation could be achieved through government action, including on regulation and taxes, redirecting the international financial system, and changes to consumer behaviour.</p>

<p>It said the transition to green electricity, transport and buildings was under way, but needed to move faster. All sectors had to avoid locking in new fossil fuel infrastructure, contrary to plans in many countries, including the UK, to develop new oil and gas fields. A study published this week found “large consensus” across all published research that new oil and gas fields are “incompatible” with the 1.5C target.</p>

<p>The UNEP report said about a third of climate-heating emissions came from the global food system and these were set to double by 2050. But the sector could be transformed if governments changed farm subsidies – which are overwhelmingly harmful to the environment – and food taxes, cut food waste and helped develop new low-carbon foods.</p>

<p>Individual citizens could adopt greener, healthier diets as well, the report said.</p>

<p>Andersen said: “I’m not preaching one diet over another, but we need to be mindful that if we all want steak every night for dinner, it won’t compute.”</p>

<p>Redirecting global financial flows to green investments was vital, the report said. Most financial groups had shown limited action to date, despite their stated intentions, due to short-term interests, it said. A transformation to a low-emissions economy was expected to need at least $4tn-6tn a year in investment, the report said, about 2% of global financial assets.</p>

<p>Despite Andersen’s doubts that the necessary emission cuts can be made by 2030, she pointed to the plummeting costs of renewables, the rollout of electric transport, major climate legislation in the US, and moves by pension funds to back low-carbon investments.</p>

<p>“It’s my job to be the ever hopeful person, but [also] to be the realistic optimist,” she said. “[This report] is the mirror that we’re holding up to the world. Obviously, I want to be proven wrong and see countries taking ambitious steps. But so far, that’s not what we’ve seen.”</p>


<h2 id="692761286984526065">‘Happy milk’: the dairy family that sustains a fair shake of the bottle</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Fat cows nursing half-grown calves aren’t a common sight on a dairy farm. Nor are empty glass milk bottles left on the front porch – not these days, anyway. But Shane Hickey, a Northern Rivers dairy farmer, isn’t afraid to challenge the status quo.</p>

<p>In 2018, at the height of the drought, he posted a video on Facebook that quickly went viral. After receiving his monthly milk cheque Hickey calculated that he’d been working for just $2.46 an hour and wouldn’t be able to cover the bills. He also called out the big supermarkets to pay more to dairy producers.</p>

<p>Although the video turned him into a minor celebrity, Hickey never got a response from the supermarkets. When he later asked for a higher price, his milk company responded that their rate was “fair and sustainable”.</p>

<p>But, he asks, “How is it fair and sustainable if we’re all going broke?”</p>

<p>Shane and Julia Hickey still farm on the family property at Lynchs Creek, near Kyogle. A lot has changed since 2018. There are lush paddocks full of clover instead of the brown, drought-affected hills in the background of Shane’s video and the Hickeys now sell the milk from their herd of 70 mostly Jersey-cross cows direct to consumers through an old-fashioned glass bottle delivery service.</p>

<p>In some ways it’s a step into the past, but Hickey says, “People want milk in glass bottles. They want home deliveries again. They want to know where their milk is coming from and the story behind it.”</p>

<p>Farm gate prices for milk producers are predicted to reach 72.5 cents a litre in 2022-23. Yet dairy farmers still face the stress of fluctuating payments and penalties even while supermarket prices remain stable.</p>

<p>In comparison, the Hickeys’ milk sells for $2.65-$3.50 per litre. Although setting up the creamery has been expensive, the family believes that their new enterprise will be worth the effort.</p>

<p>According to Hickey, one of the biggest benefits is a steady price. “Now we get the money that we need consistently for our product. There’s none of this ups and downs bullshit,” he says.</p>

<p>Local uptake of their milk delivery has been good. Customers are willing to pay a little bit more, knowing the money is going directly to the farmer.</p>

<p>Hickey is adamant: “We’ve produced a good product. We’ve done everything right by the animals, everything right by the soil, everything right by the environment. So this is what it should be worth.”</p>

<p>Selling their milk in returnable glass bottles is one way that the Hickeys have chosen to protect the environment. The bottles are cheaper than plastic and can be reused up to 50 times, although changing people’s behaviour about returning them has been a challenge.</p>

<p>The Hickeys say they farm “regeneratively”. Forgoing synthetic fertilisers and chemicals, they make their own bio fertiliser. They also keep the dairy cows with their calves, allowing the calves to consume milk that could otherwise be sold. It costs more to farm this way, but “it is not about the money”.</p>

<p>The direct-to-consumer business is easily as much work as large-scale dairying. Although he spends less time milking, Hickey can spend two days a week just washing bottles, in addition to processing the milk, making deliveries, marketing and other tasks.</p>

<p>Still, life is simpler now that the Hickeys are no longer “fighting natural cycles,” as Julia puts it, by separating cows and calves or working to industrial processors’ schedules. Shane says that dairy farmers supplying the factories often start at 3.30am, waking cows in the paddock and hurrying them in for milking, so that the milk is cold for the early morning tanker.</p>

<p>These days, instead of a morning rush, the Hickeys get family time.</p>

<p>“I get up at 6.30 and we all sit around. We have breakfast together and put the kids on the bus,” Hickey says. “Then I’ll wander up the hill and milk the cows, because they’ve come home by then by themselves. There’s no stress. Then the cows go out with the calves. Done. And I’m like, this is so much better … They’re down there, kicking their heels up, running around.”</p>

<p>The Hickeys haven’t done the maths on their new enterprise yet. After two years setting up, they are only now getting close to where they want to be. While their glass-bottled milk is becoming popular in the community, the family is focused on taking care of the animals and the environment.

<h2 id="1036791310618562791">Mondrian painting has been hanging upside down for 75 years</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>A painting by abstract Dutch artist Piet Mondrian has been hanging upside down in various museums since it was first put on display 75 years ago, an art historian has found, but warned it could disintegrate if it was hung the right side up now.</p>

<p>The 1941 picture, a complex interlacing lattice of red, yellow, black and blue adhesive tapes titled New York City I, was first put on display at New York’s MoMA in 1945 but has hung at the art collection of the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia in Düsseldorf since 1980.</p>

<p>The way the picture is currently hung shows the multicoloured lines thickening at the bottom, suggesting an extremely simplified version of a skyline. However, when curator Susanne Meyer-Büser started researching the museum’s new show on the Dutch avant garde artist earlier this year, she realised the picture should be the other way around.</p>

<p>“The thickening of the grid should be at the top, like a dark sky,” said Meyer-Büser. “Once I pointed it out to the other curators, we realised it was very obvious. I am 100% certain the picture is the wrong way around.”</p>

<p>Indicators suggesting an incorrect hanging are multifold. The similarly named and same-sized oil painting, New York City, which is on display in Paris at the Centre Pompidou, has the thickening of lines at the top.</p>

<p>A photograph of Mondrian’s studio, taken a few days after the artist’s death and published in American lifestyle magazine Town and Country in June 1944, also shows the same picture sitting on an easel the other way up.</p>

<p>Meyer-Büser said it was likely that Mondrian worked by starting his intricate layering with a line right at the top of the frame and then worked his way down, which would also explain why some of the yellow lines stop a few millimetres short of the bottom edge.</p>

<p>“Was it a mistake when someone removed the work from its box? Was someone being sloppy when the work was in transit?”, the curator said. “It’s impossible to say.”</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that unlike most of Mondrian’s earlier works, New York City I does not bear the artist’s signature, possibly because he hadn’t deemed it finished.</p>

<p>In spite of all the evidence pointing to the work being currently displayed upside down, the work will be shown the way it has hung for 75 years in the new Mondrian. Evolution show that opens in Düsseldorf on Saturday.</p>


<h2 id="1109712768920575386">Eat mushrooms, cut down on meat and use the microwave: the best diet for you and the planet</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The simplest way to reduce your personal carbon footprint is to go vegan. Growing beef takes as much as 100 times more land than growing peas or soya to produce the same amount of protein. I’ve reduced my meat consumption to some local, organic grass-fed red meat or a roast chicken as an occasional treat once or twice a month. This allows me to enjoy meat as part of my diet at a more sustainable level.</p>

<p>Studies have demonstrated no differences in gut health between vegans, vegetarians and occasional meat-eaters. The single most important dietary factor we found for better gut health was the number of different plants we eat weekly, with 30 a week being the optimal number.</p>

<p>That might sound like a lot until you realise that this also includes mushrooms, spices, nuts, seeds, herbs and legumes. Simply using a sofrito base of onions, garlic, olive oil and carrots when cooking, and adding some mixed beans or lentils to your pasta sauce or a spice mix to your cooking, or sprinkling mixed nuts and seeds on your yoghurt, can rapidly boost this number.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, many vegans over-rely on high-salt and fatty ultra-processed foods that are bad for us and the environment (some produced in large, energy-intensive factories). Newer production methods, such as cell-cultured “meat”, “fish” and even “cheese” are on the horizon, and are likely to be more environmentally friendly.</p>

<p>Brands like Symplicity (currently stocking restaurants nationwide and soon to be available to consumers) use large scale vats to ferment organic vegetables with no artificial additives, making “meatballs” and “burgers” that benefit our gut microbiome and with near zero waste.</p>

<p>We worry too much about protein. It’s pulses, beans and lentils that help centenarian populations in some cultures outlive the rest of us. This is due to their high-fibre, protein, mineral and polyphenol content (polyphenols are the plant chemicals that help our gut microbes).</p>

<p>We need iron and iodine, zinc and vitamin B-12 to be healthy, but most of us can easily absorb these from eggs, clams or mussels and chicken – the most sustainable farmed animal products – once a week.</p>

<p>In 2017, I visited the Hadza people in Tanzania and measurably improved my gut microbiome diversity in just three days by eating all the plants and seeds, fruits and nuts that they eat in one week – along with the odd porcupine.</p>

<p>Go organic, even just a little</p>

<p>Herbicides were generally considered safe before we realised the importance of microbes, both to the soil and our guts and immune systems. Our own data has shown the power of a healthy diet and microbiome to protect against severe disease.</p>

<p>Pesticides and herbicides are designed to disrupt natural ecosystems, reducing biodiversity and degrading our soils, impacting our water life and the survival of insects. We ingest these chemicals in small amounts every day and they are hard to avoid, especially with plant-based diets.</p>

<p>While it’s beneficial to only buy organic foods where possible, the current level of organic farming is insufficient to produce enough food for us all. And that’s not to mention the difference in price. Buy local and seasonal ingredients that stay fresher for longer. It’s worth prioritising certain foods: I always buy organic strawberries, oats, spinach and apples as non-organic varieties tend to have the highest levels of herbicides.</p>

<p>Cook smarter (and use the microwave)</p>

<p>We can reduce cooking-fuel consumption and preserve the beneficial chemicals in food by harnessing the power of microbes to ferment and preserve leftover vegetables.</p>

<p>Kimchi, for example, uses cabbage, green veg, garlic and chillies, while heating food in a microwave saves energy while generally maintaining the nutrient content. I now microwave a whole potato instead of baking it, and steam spinach in the microwave too. I make vegetable soups, ferment leftover vegetables (such as sauerkraut or beetroot), eat the hard outer leaves of cauliflower, and freeze softening fruits.</p>

<p>The science on fish has changed, and it is now clear that the health benefits of fish and omega-3 fats have been overrated. Studies of omega-3 supplements show no clinical benefit unless you’re pregnant or have had a recent heart attack, and fish is less beneficial for the heart than we thought. Plus most fish we now eat in the UK, including salmon and trout, come from non-sustainable aquatic farms.</p>

<p>Use a local fishmonger or supermarket fish counter you trust and can ask questions. Mussels and clams are healthy, largely sustainable and very tasty.</p>

<p>Dairy is a massive cause of global heating, and its health benefits, such as improving calcium intake and strengthening bones, have been overplayed. There are plenty of better sources of calcium, for example, sesame seeds and tahini, dark-green leafy vegetables and calcium-set tofu. Although dairy alternatives are better overall for greenhouse emissions, they can cause other problems; the excessive amount of water used to create almond milk and its harmfulness to bees, for example. Others, such as soya and oat milks, can be highly processed.</p>

<p>Personally, the only milk I haven’t given up is fermented milk, known as kefir, which I make myself and have a little shot of every day for my gut microbiome.</p>

<p>The fact is, there is no one diet that suits us all. But the rapidly emerging field of personalised nutrition (led by companies including ZOE, which I co-founded) suggests that, by predicting which foods best suit our body, we can reduce sugar and fat peaks in our blood and improve our gut health. We can feel better, have more energy and feel less hungry – all without discussing calories.</p>

<p>But as we wait for technology including apps, at-home tests and continuous glucose monitors to help us eat more healthily, we can make positive changes by following the broad approaches described here. Meanwhile, listen to your body and eat more of what makes you feel good.</p>

<p>Nobody’s perfect, and the enjoyment of food, and the social interaction that comes with it, can be as important as environmental and health considerations. Even small positive changes can go a long way.</p>

<h2 id="280948127326493549">Andy Warhol work not seen in public for 15 years could fetch $80m at auction</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Six months after a vivid image of Marilyn Monroe smashed records when it sold for $195m, a rather more dark and brutal work by the cult pop artist Andy Warhol may also be about to fetch a large sum.</p>

<p>White Disaster (White Car Crash 19 Times) – repeated graphic black and white images across a huge canvas measuring 12ft tall and 6ft wide – is expected to sell for at least $80m in New York next month.</p>

<p>It is part of Warhol’s 1960s Death and Disaster series that reflected the artist’s preoccupation with mortality. The last large Death and Disaster painting sold at auction, Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster), fetched $105m in 2013.</p>

<p>Sotheby’s, which will auction the piece on behalf of a private owner on 16 November, described it as a “monumental masterpiece”. It has not been on public view for more than 15 years.</p>

<p>Referring to Warhol’s devout Catholicism, Sotheby’s said: “There is no doubt that the physical magnitude of the panel – the largest of all Warhol’s single-panel car crash works – has the power to invoke a sense of awe and reverence akin to that of a religious altarpiece. In fact, the religious overtones of the work extend beyond its mere scale.”</p>

<p>It quoted the art historian John Richardson as saying: “The whole repetition of Andy’s imagery stems from the fact that he was Catholic. He went to church, he went to confession, he had to do 10 Hail Marys, 20 Ave Marias, and all this is reflected in the way his imagery is repeated again and again and again.”</p>

<p>Warhol began silkscreening images of car accidents, plane crashes and other catastrophes in the early 1960s, using photographs from newspapers and police archives as source material.</p>

<p>“When you see a gruesome picture over and over again, it really doesn’t have any effect,” he told an interviewer in 1963.</p>

<p>Warhol was raised by his devout Catholic mother, Julia, with whom he prayed daily throughout the two decades in which they shared a New York home. He went to church regularly, met the pope, and financed his nephew’s studies to become a priest.</p>


<h2 id="1346942017056307594">‘We’re booked until April 2023’: The White Lotus effect on Sicily’s glitziest town</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>It must have been like manna from heaven when, in October 2020, HBO decided to locate its new hit drama, The White Lotus, at the Four Seasons on Maui, Hawaii. The luxury resort had been closed since the islands locked down in late March, but this meant suites could be reopened for filming and furloughed staff brought back to work.</p>

<p>Now it’s the turn of another Four Seasons hotel, the San Domenico Palace in Taormina, Sicily, to be the star turn for the second series, which airs from October 31 on HBO/Sky Atlantic. Though lockdown is now just a memory for Italy, the choice of one of Sicily’s most beautiful towns (and certainly its glitziest) was welcomed by a country hit hard – and early – by the pandemic. The arrival of the international cast and crew in February was forecast to mean a €2m boost to the town’s hotels, rental flats, bars and restaurants, along with work opportunities for local people, including roles as extras. And the benefits are expected to continue.</p>

<p>“These have been intense months,” said Gabriele Zuccaro, owner of Ristorante Badia in the town centre, “but [director] Mike White’s team has showed off all the loveliest parts of Taormina. For our town it is extraordinary worldwide publicity.”</p>

<p>But will the bling of Hawaii translate to the luccichio of Taormina? The design team for the first season found the Four Seasons Resort Maui too bland for filming, and added brighter soft furnishings, flowers and plants, to make a hotel that was “kitschy and flawed and rich, like the characters”. In the way of luxury hotels the world over, the San Domenico Palace is similarly muted – white linens and sandy neutrals – so may have received the same treatment, though the flashy marble bathroom of its most expensive suite (about €5,000 a night) features prominently in the season-two trailer.</p>

<p>Visitor numbers to Maui in the first half of 2022 recovered to within a whisker of pre-pandemic levels, with spending up by more than 16%. The hotel’s general manager, Ben Shank, told journalists the phone had been ringing nonstop since the show aired. “It’s taken on a life of its own. You couldn’t imagine the amount of calls we’ve gotten.”</p>

<p>In Sicily, the San Domenico Palace, a former monastery overlooking the sea, has similarly reported being “booked to April 2023”, but now, in shoulder season, with pleasant temperatures in the low 20s, there is plenty of availability for those happy to pay Four Seasons-level prices (doubles this weekend from €1,050, including an “exceptional” breakfast).</p>

<p>Despite Maui’s Four Seasons oozing luxury, director Mike White found it dispiriting: “You go to these places where you’re supposed to be escaping from all of the problems of the world, and you realise you can’t really escape them,” he told the Los Angeles Times. “The sense of unease you feel is almost amplified in places where you’re supposed to feel so relaxed.”</p>

<p>You don’t need to be in a billionaire bolthole to enjoy Taormina’s beauty – though the generous sprinkling of super-rich visitors does mean the people-watching on Piazza IX Aprile is just as fascinating as the ancient Greek theatre and the volcano views.</p>

<p>Nor do you need to be a billionaire. For about a tenth of the cost of the San Domenico Palace, visitors can stay at another former monastery, the Splendid Hotel (doubles from €115, B&B), half a mile away. It has a pool and restaurant, and is handy for the cable car down to Mazzarò beach. And if valet parking à la San Domenico is important, you can have this too, for €15 a day.</p>

<p>The first season of White Lotus was praised for showing the malign influence of the wealthy visitors on local people, but also for treating Hawaii as a character in itself, rather than as a backdrop. The new location also has much to offer: from the towering bulk of Etna to ancient Syracuse further south, eastern Sicily is as well supplied with wonders as Four Seasons guests are with Gucci luggage.</p>


<h2 id="1405025481520436213">Rihanna: Lift Me Up review – good girl gone drab?</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I remember, vividly, waiting up one night in early 2016 to listen to Work, the first single from Rihanna’s eighth album, Anti. I was expecting some kind of supreme banger – a hit of equivalent euphoria to songs like We Found Love or Only Girl in the World. When I heard the song, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a little soft – a sad, surprisingly elliptical return. I filed it away under “sub-par Rihanna songs” only for it to work its way into my heart over the next few months; now it’s one of my favourite pop songs ever and a clear precedent for a wave of pop stars intent on singing about the quotidian drudgery of celebrity. (It also contains one of the most perfect pop lyrics – “Nobody text me in a crisis.”)</p>

<p>Rihanna’s first new track in six years, Lift Me Up, feels similarly limp on arrival – although perhaps with less chance of escaping from the also-rans pile. Written and recorded for the soundtrack to the forthcoming Black Panther sequel, it’s hardly the klaxon for a radical new era of Rihanna and is likely unrelated to the supposedly reggae-influenced ninth album that fans are breathlessly anticipating. Instead it’s a soft, swaying ballad built around a lovely arpeggiating harp and serene strings courtesy of Ludwig Göransson (who composed the Black Panther score).</p>

<p>The track’s lyrics (“Lift me up / Hold me down / Keep me safe / Safe and sound”) are light and frankly anonymous, a far cry from the brilliant, world-weary and starkly emotional lyrics of Anti. It feels like a money talks kind of song: it’s telling that the only two things luring Rihanna away from fashion and cosmetics and back into music in the coming months are the Super Bowl half-time show and a Marvel film sure to be a mega-hit. (There are indications that the industry, too, is holding out its hype for the “real” Rihanna return – Spotify’s New Music Friday playlist features the R&B singer SZA on its cover today, rather than Rihanna: basically an acknowledgment that this isn’t the “true” comeback single.)</p>

<p>The most notable feature of Lift Me Up is its writing credits: it was co-written by rising Nigerian alté star Tems, and you can hear her presence in the graceful and – for a Rihanna song – unusually ornamental verse melody. Still, there is little of the heft and power of Tems songs such as Free Mind or Damages in this track – just breezy harp, swelling strings and, faint in the background, the sound of a bunch of Marvel executives rubbing their hands together.</p>


<h2 id="1477923098929634318">Benjamina Ebuehi’s recipe for pumpkin spice mini doughnuts with maple cream | The sweet spot</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Pumpkin spice lattes are not my thing, but give me the flavours of pumpkin with all those autumnal spices in any other format and I’m sold. These little doughnuts are ridiculously easy to make, much faster than the traditional yeasted kind, so you can have them hot out of the fryer in less than an hour. These have got a soft, more cake-like texture thanks to the pumpkin puree – I use tinned for ease, but you could blitz up your own if you have some squash to use up.</p>

<p>For the doughnuts</p>

<p>200g pumpkin puree</p>

<p>2 large eggs</p>

<p>1 tsp vanilla bean paste</p>

<p>200g plain flour</p>

<p>65g caster sugar, plus extra to finish</p>

<p>2 tsp baking powder</p>

<p>2 tsp cinnamon, plus extra to finish</p>

<p>½ tsp ground nutmeg</p>

<p>1 tsp ginger</p>

<p>¼ tsp ground cloves</p>

<p>A pinch of salt</p>

<p>50g unsalted butter, melted</p>

<p>Sunflower oil, for deep-frying</p>

<p>For the maple cream</p>

<p>200ml double cream</p>

<p>2 tbsp maple syrup</p>

<p>A pinch of salt</p>

<p>Mix the pumpkin puree, eggs and vanilla in a bowl until smooth.</p>

<p>In another bowl, combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, spices and salt. Make a well in the centre and pour in the pumpkin mixture and melted butter. Stir until just combined, cover and leave to sit at room temperature for about half an hour.</p>

<p>Mix three tablespoons of caster sugar and a half-teaspoon of cinnamon in a shallow dish and set aside.</p>

<p>To make the maple cream, whip the cream and maple syrup to stiff peaks and chill in the fridge until needed.</p>

<p>Half-fill a medium-sized saucepan with oil and heat it to 170C using a thermometer; alternatively, test by dropping in a drop of batter – it should sizzle and float to the surface (if it browns in seconds, the oil is too hot).</p>

<p>Drop heaped teaspoons of the batter into the oil and cook for a minute or two on each side, until they are deep golden in colour. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and place on a plate lined with kitchen paper. While the doughnuts are still hot, toss them in the cinnamon sugar and serve with the maple cream.</p>


<h2 id="746456344040009700">You be the judge: should my partner get rid of our lockdown wormery?</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I like nature, just not in my living room. The worms get everywhere – and the food scraps stink</p>

<p>During lockdown, my partner Cindy and I were stuck at home, bored like everyone else, so started developing new hobbies. Cindy thought it would be fun to get a wormery and keep it on the balcony of our flat.</p>

<p>Our council doesn’t take food waste, so it was going to be a good way to be more eco-friendly, passing our food scraps on to the worms. We had grand ideas of transforming the balcony, filling it with amazing plants and flowers. That didn’t happen, but we still have a large wormery, which has become a pain.</p>

<p>When the worms arrived, a couple escaped from the bag. I came home once, saw them on the floor, and said, “What the hell is this?” I like nature, but not in my living room. When we go away, I have this anxiety they might escape again. I’m also worried about them falling through cracks in our balcony.</p>

<p>The leftover food is also an issue. We keep it in boxes and it quickly turns rotten and mouldy. I convinced Cindy to keep the box on the balcony, so it wouldn’t stink indoors, but she’d find excuses not to take it out. If it was raining, she wouldn’t want to. Then she suggested putting our scraps through the blender – she said mixing the eggshells and vegetables together would actually be better for the worms. Cindy never even uses the blender to cook for herself, so I said no.</p>

<p>This summer lots of the worms died as it was so hot. Cindy was sad. I didn’t rejoice as they are living creatures, but did say: “Maybe the wormery isn’t a good idea?” I suggested contacting schools, parks and the council to see if they’d take it. Cindy hasn’t contacted anyone yet.</p>

<p>We spent the first year of lockdown growing things. Since then it’s been a question of: “Shall we do the balcony or go out with friends?” We’ve picked the latter. When I suggest moving the wormery, Cindy makes a really sad face and it breaks my heart. But if we keep the wormery, we should improve the whole balcony like we planned, as right now it’s the same old – only with a messy box of worms on it.</p>

<p>The wormery is an eco-friendly slice of nature. And it doesn’t stink – it smells of the woods</p>

<p>The wormery is great. I love it. You put food waste in there and the worms help break it down. Yes, it’s a bit disgusting: it’s not what most people dream about, but it’s a slice of nature on your balcony. And it’s good for the environment.</p>

<p>We have always kept our food waste in plastic boxes. The food has to be quite rotten for the worms to eat, as they don’t have teeth, so when we kept the boxes inside, I’d wait for the food to become really mouldy before putting it in the wormery. In the summer, as we had the windows open, flies came in. So I started to put the food straight outside. I agreed to that change, but I don’t like to go on to the balcony when it rains. I do try to hide the mess so Leandra doesn’t get annoyed.</p>

<p>The worms have only broken free once, so it isn’t a huge deal, but I can’t guarantee that it won’t happen again. One time Leandra got annoyed as she was repotting a plant on the balcony and found some worms in the soil, but they are good for the plants.</p>

<p>Worms eat the leftover food, then poop it out as a free source of high-quality plant nutrients. The wormery doesn’t stink; it smells like the woods. I like the scent.</p>

<p>I notice when the worms are reproducing, and I like watching how they act together to break down the food. I look at the fluctuation in their activities, how they behave in different temperatures. I was very sad when loads of them died in the heatwave this summer. The colony almost became extinct.</p>

<p>I’ve already inspired one colleague to get a wormery. He gave me the idea for blending the scraps. It would increase the output of the colony if Leandra would let me do that, but I understand why she said no.</p>

<p>I think we both need to make an effort if we want a nicer balcony, but the wormery has made it better. Leandra would really like to get rid of it, but you never know when the next lockdown will be, so I think it’s important to keep it.</p>

<p>Should the wormery stay or go?</p>

<p>Maintaining a messy hobby just in case there’s another lockdown is pretty unreasonable. Though it sounds like the rotting food is more of an issue than the worms themselves, and Cindy seems to be very nonchalant about that.</p>

<p>Laura, 30</p>

<p>The wormery is a nice idea in principle but it’s not really working on the balcony of their flat post-lockdown. It seems like it’s hard work – which Cindy is not wholly committed to.</p>

<p>Chris, 68</p>

<p>The wormery is Cindy’s hobby, and it seems it’s only a mild inconvenience to Leandra. The issue could be solved by getting a sealed outdoor compost bin for the food scraps. I think by working together to improve their balcony, and making the wormery a fun feature, they could both be happy.</p>

<p>Zoe, 35</p>

<p>Cindy is guilty of instigating the wormery and then failing to take responsibility for its conservancy. Nonetheless, with regard to Leandra’s anxiety about further escape attempts, worms are not known for their agility or ingenuity. It should be a fairly simple task to contain them.</p>

<p>Jon, 55</p>

<p>I think the wormery was a lockdown hobby that has outstayed its welcome. While I love the creativity of the idea, something as disruptive as this needs passion from both parties to sustain it. It sounds like it’s making Leandra anxious and resentful, and may have a negative impact on their relationship.</p>

<p>Rushda, 36</p>

<p>Now you be the judge</p>

<p>In our online poll below, tell us: should the wormery stay or go?</p>

<p>The poll closes on Thursday 3 November at 10 am GMT</p>

<p>We asked if Niamh should listen to her friend Martha and make more of an effort to keep in touch.</p>

<p>19% of you said yes – Niamh is guilty</p>

<p>81% of you said no – Niamh is not guilty</p>


<h2 id="1904872893519826094">Windfall tax must change in face of ‘excessive’ oil profits, Alok Sharma says</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The UK’s windfall tax on oil and gas profits must be changed to raise billions more and to stop companies using loopholes to invest in further fossil fuel extraction, the outgoing president of global climate talks has said.</p>

<p>“These are excessive profits, and they have to be treated in the appropriate way when it comes to taxation,” said Alok Sharma, the president of the Cop26 UN climate summit. “We ought to be going further and seeing what more can be done in terms of raising additional finance [from the profits]. So far, at least, the level of money raised is obviously not significant.”</p>

<p>The UK is facing a cost of living crisis and the Treasury needs to fill an estimated £50bn hole in the country’s finances.</p>

<p>Shell admitted this week it had paid no windfall tax despite having made a record $30bn in profits for the year so far.</p>

<p>The oil company said it had taken advantage of a loophole exempting companies that invest their surplus in increasing oil and gas extraction. On Friday, the US fossil fuel firm ExxonMobil reported a quarterly profit of nearly $20bn, $4bn more than forecast.</p>

<p>Sharma said: “There really is an incentive for these companies to do more in terms of oil and gas. What we want them to do, if we are to meet our target of 100% clean energy by 2035, is to accelerate the renewables rollout.”</p>

<p>He also said the UK’s push for more gas extraction – the government is licensing new drilling in the North Sea, and offering tax breaks for increased production from existing wells – was at odds with the legally binding commitment to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p>

<p>“The International Energy Agency has been clear that in terms of new fields, they don’t think that’s consistent with a 1.5C pathway, and the onus is on every government – including the UK – to explain how any policies they have on oil and gas, or any other policy, is consistent with their legally binding commitments.”</p>

<p>He said companies should be offered incentives to increase their investment in renewables rather than fossil fuels. “That is the way you get faster delivery of renewable energy across the UK,” he told the Guardian. “What we want to see is a big expansion in renewables.”</p>

<p>Sharma was praised around the world for his role in directing the Cop26 UN climate talks last November in Glasgow, where he forged a global pact to limit temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. His role as president of the talks ends next week, when the Cop27 summit begins in Egypt.</p>

<p>This week he was stripped of his cabinet position by Rishi Sunak, raising concerns among environmentalists about the incoming prime minister’s commitment to tackling the climate emergency.</p>

<p>Sharma and Graham Stuart, the climate minister, will keep their current roles but not attend cabinet, leaving the government for the first time in years without a cabinet minister focused on the climate crisis.</p>

<p>Downing Street said on Thursday that Sunak would not attend Cop27, in asnub to the Egyptian hosts and to the US president, Joe Biden, who will attend.</p>

<p>One developed country diplomat closely involved with the Cop27 talks told the Guardian: “It appears as if the new prime minister wants to wash his hands of the previously strong role the government played on international climate action. Plus, it’s another stab in the back for Sharma.”</p>

<p>Sharma, however, defended the prime minister. “Rishi Sunak has actually made a pretty good start on these issues. He has already ruled out fracking … and he said in response to a question at PMQs [prime minister’s questions] that we will deliver on what we said at Cop[26]. The reason for that is that he obviously cares very deeply about passing on to our children an environment in a better state than we found ourselves. That is a really positive statement.”</p>

<p>Sunak’s predecessor, Liz Truss, in effect forbade King Charles from attending Cop27, which raised diplomatic protests around the world, as the king has been a major figure at previous Cops, including Glasgow and the 2015 summit that produced the landmark Paris climate agreement. Downing Street confirmed on Friday that the king would not attend, although Egypt’s foreign minister in charge of Cop27, Sameh Shoukry, told the Guardian the invitation was still open.</p>

<p>Speaking before Downing Street’s confirmation, Sharma said King Charles was regarded as an international leader on climate. “He’s been focused on this for decades, well before this was mainstream. And of course he’s also head of [state] of a number of other nations, some of whom are on the frontline of climate change. I would very much like him to be there but ultimately that is a matter between him and the government.”</p>

<p>With the war in Ukraine, and a standoff between the US and China over Taiwan, the prospects for Cop27 have dimmed. Sharma left Cop26 warning that the 1.5C limit – beyond which the impacts of the climate crisis will swiftly become catastrophic and irreversible – was “on life support”.</p>

<p>In the past week the UN has released two reports showing that governments have failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions fast enough to meet the 1.5C goal, with current short-term pledges on emissions likely to raise temperatures by 2.5C. Only 24 countries have come forward with fresh emissions-cutting plans since Cop26, despite all at Glasgow having promised to do so.</p>

<p>Sharma said it was still possible to make progress at Cop27 on reducing emissions. “What we have seen [since Cop26] is the geopolitics change quite significantly … with Putin’s illegal war in Ukraine. That has resulted in world leaders having to deal with immediate issues in terms of an energy crisis, food security issues, rising inflation, rising debt levels. That’s completely understandable. However, what we’ve also seen is that the chronic threat of climate change has not gone away; it’s got worse.”</p>

<p>Sharma has spent much of his time as Cop26 president – his term was prolonged after the Covid pandemic delayed Cop26 by a year – speaking to and visiting developing countries on the frontline of the crisis.</p>

<p>“I was at the UN general assembly a few weeks ago, and I had an opportunity to speak with the Pakistani minister for climate change. It was really incredibly moving to hear her speak about the terrible peril that so many millions are now facing in Pakistan as a result of one-third of the country being under water – the same size of land under water as the UK itself,” he said.</p>

<p>“You’ve got 5 million people facing a food crisis, and more recently you’ve seen flooding in Nigeria, the worst floods in a decade, with a million people displaced. So what countries are going to need to do is, while they deal with the immediate issues [of energy and food prices], they also then continue to deal with the issue of global warming.”</p>

<p>Soaring gas prices have sent governments – including the UK – back to fossil fuels, but Sharma said this was likely to be temporary as renewable energy was cheaper. “The war has meant countries are accelerating their clean energy transitions and going faster than they would otherwise have done. To meet immediate energy needs, you are seeing some countries doing more fossil, more coal, but you’re also seeing them absolutely doubling down on more renewables.”</p>

<p>Sharma, who supported Boris Johnson’s truncated attempt to return as UK prime minister, faces an uncertain political future when his term as Cop president ends. But he vowed to continue to speak out: “I am no longer a [cabinet] minister but I have a voice. I will use that voice. Ultimately, we will be judged as a government on whether we keep the promises that we have made and whether we deliver on our commitments.”</p>


<h2 id="285083849578770221">‘Why not just go the full Vegas?’ The crass, ad-laden reinvention of central London</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>‘Coarse in the extreme,” was how the architectural historian Nikolaus Pevsner described Centre Point in 1973. In his eyes, the white concrete office tower – which stands at the junction of New Oxford Street and Charing Cross Road like a gleaming signpost for central London – was a brute slab, every floor wrapped with a “remorseless horizontal zigzag”.</p>

<p>Fifty years later, it’s hard to imagine the words he would use to describe the tower’s new neighbours. Since the arrival of Crossrail, that great subterranean aquifer of people and property speculation, the northern end of Charing Cross Road has become a dumping ground for some of the most crass commercial architecture the capital has ever seen. We were promised that the Elizabeth Line would bring outer London closer to the centre. We weren’t told it would bring the crap out-of-town sheds with it.</p>

<p>On one prized corner of the junction, squatting over an entrance to the new Tottenham Court Road station, is Soho Place. Twelve years in the making, this £300m mixed-use development by Derwent manages to be both grim and gaudy. It greets the street with a funereal black office block, its 10-storeys clad with thin horizontal bands of limestone, clipped on to the facade like flimsy cardboard. It looks like the kind of building you might find on the edge of a 1980s business park in Slough, not the centre of a place that still likes to think of itself as a global city. Perhaps it makes a fitting gateway to what Oxford Street has become: a tawdry sewer of tourist tat shops and American candy stores.</p>

<p>To the south – on the other side of a paved area garnished with hostile vehicle mitigation barriers, optimistically described as a “civic plaza” – stands a brand new theatre. It is the first purpose-built venue in the West End in 50 years, not that you would know it from the outside. It takes the form of an officey six-storey glass box, framed by polished steel columns, with another three floors of offices poking out of the top. The columns’ mirrored cladding is thin and warped, giving it the look of kitchen foil, while the glass curtain wall has a similarly bowed surface, reflecting the surroundings in a buckled mess. In an attempt to add a touch of exclusive sparkle to proceedings, the motley pile has been crowned with a private rooftop bar, topped with a canopy inexplicably decorated with astrological symbols. We can only assume Mercury was firmly in retrograde when Westminster’s planning committee waved this monster through.</p>

<p>Soho Place is the work of AHMM, whose director, Simon Allford, current president of the RIBA, describes it as “the architecture and design of a Swiss watch but built on an urban scale”. In truth, it feels more like a cheap knock-off. Digital screens cling to the facade, advertising the programme of the theatre, which has been branded @sohoplace, as if permanently trapped on Twitter. The 600-seat auditorium is a welcome arrival, with generous legroom compared to the cramped Victorian theatres nearby. But what a missed opportunity to create a truly magical, theatrical addition to Soho – not something that feels like it has been squeezed into the base of a converted office. It will make many wistful for the Astoria, the sticky-floored theatre-turned-music venue that once stood on the site, demolished in 2009 to make way for Crossrail.</p>

<p>On the other side of the road is a project that hopes to fill the venue void – and then some. Dubbed Outernet, it is the £1bn reinvention of an entire urban block, with four new live venues, ranging from a 2,000 capacity mega-basement to more intimate bars and clubs along the music mecca of Denmark Street. It has entailed a fiendishly complex process of mining and burrowing, while restoring 17th-century structures above. But its most visible presence at street level, on the corner next to Centre Point, is one of the strangest structures in London. The Now Building is the most extreme evolution of advertising yet: a gigantic walk-in billboard, ready to immerse you deeper in more brands than you ever thought you wanted.</p>

<p>Featuring three times as much screen area as Piccadilly Circus, it is as if Times Square had collapsed in on itself, forming a 360-degree brandscape designed to bombard you with messaging from all directions. “We have created what every city centre in the world wants,” claims Laurence Kirschel, founder of Consolidated Developments, the company behind the project. “This is an open public space, covered for inclement weather, with free entertainment. It’s like a charitable gift.”</p>

<p>Kirschel has been walking the streets of Soho since he was 18. Trained as a surveyor and valuer, he worked with Paul Raymond, the notorious porn baron and self-styled “King of Soho”, and went on to own Ronnie Scott’s jazz bar and develop the Soho Hotel. “My history is the cleanup campaign of Soho,” he tells me. “I got a commendation from Westminster for cleaning up more buildings in one year than they had done in 10.”</p>

<p>Outernet is his most ambitious cleansing operation yet. Kirschel has spent the last 25 years buying up properties in the area to realise what he calls “a new home for British music”, an “integrated canvas” of venues, shops and bars that, he hopes, “will save the public-facing music industry in the UK”. His challenge has been to retain the heritage of Denmark Street, while inserting the turbocharged new facilities in between, under and around it.</p>

<p>Millions were spent moving a 17th-century smithy, formerly home to the famous 12 Bar Club, in order to burrow a further three floors below, and replace it within 7mm of its original location. It has been reborn as The Lower Third, a bar and 400-capacity venue, which links to the vast Here concert venue excavated behind (where one green room features a 40-person shower).</p>

<p>Next door, a non-profit recording studio, digitally linked to the venues and designated busking points, will allow musicians to cut live albums, all connected in a “curated ecosystem”. Johnny Rotten’s graffiti has been preserved as a heritage feature. The corollary, which helps to pay for all this, is the lumbering beast on the corner, and the transformation of the entire block into a high-security, branded quarter.</p>

<p>Charing Cross Road marks the boundary between the boroughs of Westminster and Camden, and it now looks like the frontline in a battle of bad buildings, as if each side of the street is trying to outdo the other in garish glitz. While Soho Place opts for mirror-polished silver, its Camden counterpart has gone for gold – by the shedload. Three-storey high golden louvres run around the facade of the Now Building, set within a frame of polished black granite, with further golden flaps running along the top. Everything can rotate and slide back at the touch of a button to reveal yet more advertising screens.</p>

<p>“Why black and gold?” says Kirschel. “Because form follows function. We want the top Bond Street brands in here – Chanel, Gucci, Cartier – and they all use those colours. We’re playing a psychological game to make it home from home for them.”</p>

<p>The architect, John McRae of Orms, prefers more historic allusions. He cites the influence of art deco cinemas, and the handsome National Radiator Building opposite Liberty, a symphony in black and gold designed by Raymond Hood and Gordon Jeeves in the 1920s. You can see Outernet’s attempt at theatrical spectacle – the louvres are a nod to theatre curtains being drawn back – but it falls flat, as if trying to dress the brash reality in a decorous costume. If you’re going to build a temple to advertising, why not pull out all the stops and go full Vegas?</p>

<p>The project is billed as “the future of immersive brand storytelling”, ready to serve “unrivalled experiences that drive maximum impact and awareness” to the 150,000 people that disgorge from the station each day. Its CEO, Philip O’Ferrall, who has a background in television, is keen to stress that the screens will show “editorial content” 48% of the time, but so far it is hard to differentiate the brand partnerships from the ads.</p>

<p>There is a promising digital art programme, sponsored by BMW and headed by Marco Brambilla (whose mesmerising Heaven’s Gate animation shows the spectacular potential of the wraparound screens), but the artworks will only be shown on Sunday afternoons. If you download the app, meanwhile, you will be pinged with further ads as you walk through the surrounding streets, which are dotted with RFID tags and Bluetooth beacons, along with 160 facial-recognition cameras that track your every move.</p>

<p>“This is one of the securest corners in London,” says Kirschel. “We’ve created a matrix of private streets that we can shut down as we wish.” He leads me down an alleyway that connects to the venues and to his music-themed hotel, Chateau Denmark, where another LED-screen-lined tunnel leads to Denmark Street. Every entrance to the block is flanked by security guards and gates that can be closed at will, making the place feel somewhat less like the free public space he described. The whole complex, Kirschel explains, has been designed with red-carpet events in mind, so Hollywood A-listers can be whisked securely from limousine to screen, while elevators can take pop stars from their bedrooms straight down to the venues below – everything linked by broadcast-quality streaming connections.</p>

<p>“You can watch your band rehearsing while you’re having a massage in your suite,” says O’Ferrall, pointing out the flatscreen TV in front of the four-poster bed in one of the rooms, where disco balls hang above a free-standing bath. The suites are kitsch rockstar fantasies, equipped with £60,000 space-age Void speakers, rubber floors, and fully stocked bars, along with huge subwoofers in the bathrooms, for body-rocking bass while you’re on the loo.</p>

<p>Do not disturb cards have been replaced with neon “SINNING” signs – “Because the chances are you will be,” laughs Kirschel. The saucy tone is set at the entrance, where the reception is flanked by a pair of thrones upholstered with red PVC, as if vacuum-sealed inside gimp suits. But this is not the seedy Soho of yore: rooms go from £450 to £3,500 a night, while the rooftop restaurant, designed as a fake Chinese courtyard house, offers wagyu beef for £95. The Guardian’s restaurant critic described it as an “Instagram content fulfilment hub” – an apt tagline for the whole £1bn endeavour.</p>

<p>The death of Denmark Street has been overplayed: Kirschel has pumped more than many developers would into restoring the listed buildings and supporting the businesses during the pandemic. The guitar and piano shop owners I spoke to couldn’t be happier with their landlord and the buzz he is trying to bring back, while Camden has ensured the shop units will always remain music-focused.</p>

<p>“It feels a lot more connected than before,” says Jan Smosarski, who runs Sixty Sixty Sounds and has worked on the street for 14 years. “There wasn’t a real sense of community, with fractured owners that warred a lot, but now there’s a lot more integration between the stores.” The character might have changed, but “you have to reach out to new audiences,” he says, “you need to have a handover to a new generation.” Without doubt, this is Soho for the Web3 era, a cleansed, curated and branded version of the rock’n’roll experience. Kirschel tells me he has trademarked the names Denmark Street and Tin Pan Alley, and promises a “merch store” coming soon.</p>

<p>Outernet boasts of being “the world’s foremost bridge between the real world and the digital world”, a place where the metaverse meets meatspace, where virtual luxury trainers can be sold as NFTs alongside the real thing. There are plans for it to grow into a worldwide network of 10 connected hubs, with New York and Los Angeles next on the list. But it shows what happens when urban development is conceived in the same way as making a website or running a TV channel – “curating a brand neighbourhood,” as O’Ferrall puts it. Pings, clicks and content trump human experience, until advertising swallows the city whole.</p>


<h2 id="2295226430415429363">Drink Masters: the Netflix show that’s like a boozy Bake Off – for dreadful people</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I’ve never been to a Netflix commissioning meeting, but at this stage I’m largely convinced that it just takes the form of a massive tombola filled with every conceivable profession on Earth. The drum gets spun, a profession is drawn out, then Netflix goes and makes a televised competition show about it. In recent years the platform has given us programmes about fashion design, metalwork, glass-blowing, flower arranging and (many, many times over) cookery. If we play our cards right, who knows what might be next? Scaffolding? Goat herding? Chartered accounting?</p>

<p>For now, though, we will have to make do with the latest entry: a mixologist competition show entitled Drink Masters. This, you have to admit, represents something of an open goal. After so many endless programmes about food, it is slightly baffling to realise that nobody ever thought to make a show about drinks. What could possibly have been stopping them?</p>

<p>Well, on the basis of Drink Masters, quite a few things. The show apes The Great British Bake Off, in that it gathers a number of contestants in a studio and slowly whittles them down with a number of theme-based challenges. But The Great British Bake Off isn’t popular because it’s about food. No, it’s popular because it’s lovely. The people are lovely, the food is lovely, and there’s an all-encompassing air of camaraderie that permeates every second on-screen.</p>

<p>However, Drink Masters is a show about mixologists, a profession that doesn’t usually scream “lovely”. In fact, judging by the people they have picked, what it screams is “wild, untrammelled egomania”. Almost without exception, the contestants here have a cartoonishly high opinion of themselves. Lots of beards. Lots of hats. So many semi-ironic statement glasses. One of them speaks only in the third person. It is as if Urban Outfitters developed a personality-manipulating brain implant, and these people happened to be its test subjects. In this sense, Drink Masters acts as a form of public service. After all, if these people are on television, it means they aren’t boring the pants off someone who has accidentally made eye contact with them at a house party.</p>

<p>Minimal camaraderie, too. Within minutes of the show starting, a pair of hipster edgelords are at each other’s throats about who gets to use a certain ingredient. It’s a weird throwback to a far worse time, like the greatest reality show that 2007 never produced. You keep expecting Donald Trump to waltz in and foul things up, not least because of the gratuitous gold leaf that gets slung about the place willy-nilly.</p>

<p>Which isn’t to say that Drink Masters is entirely without worth. Yes, the format is stale. Yes, the contestants are annoying. But at least the production design is decent. Lots of these Netflix reality shows look as if they were filmed on the cheap in a basement – in terms of presentation, Is It Cake? was essentially a hostage video – but Drink Masters is set in a veritable cathedral. It is an enormous bar, with every spirit imaginable reaching all the way up to the ceiling. If nothing else, it is quite nice to look at.</p>

<p>And it turns out there is an unexpected element of danger to making cocktails. One poor guy in episode one is so insanely hapless that he drops a gigantic chunk of dry ice into his cocktail before serving it to the judges. The genuine fury on their faces, as they explain that this is less a drink and more a documented case of attempted murder, is weirdly pleasing to watch.</p>

<p>I can’t work out why Drink Masters didn’t land with me as well as I would have liked. Perhaps it isn’t my cup of tea. Or perhaps the timing is exceptionally bad; I don’t know if anyone is eager to watch a show about wildly expensive drinks at a time when people can’t afford to heat their own homes.</p>

<p>Either way, it’s worth checking out at least an episode. If you can stomach any more than that without tuning out owing to the format’s sheer punishing repetition, you’re a better person than me. Perhaps the scaffolding series will be better.</p>


<h2 id="286651032807645535">Elon Musk completes Twitter takeover amid hate speech concerns</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The world’s richest man, Elon Musk, has completed his $44bn acquisition of Twitter, amid warnings from politicians and campaigners that hate speech on the platform must be held in check.</p>

<p>The social media group confirmed the deal in a brief filing on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday morning, disclosing the deal had closed the day before. Shares in the company have been suspended and will delist on 8 November, capping a chaotic saga that began when the billionaire first announced his plans to take the tech business private in April.</p>

<p>Musk marked the transaction with a post to his 110 million followers declaring the “bird has been freed”, in a reference to the company’s corporate logo, before adding: “let the good times roll”.</p>

<p>Musk is expected to take on the role of chief executive at Twitter, while he searches for new leadership. Shortly after taking the helm, he reportedly ousted several senior figures, including the chief executive, Parag Agrawal; the chief financial officer, Ned Segal; and the head of legal policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde.</p>

<p>Segal tweeted on Friday that he had “concluded 5 years @twitter”. On Friday Martha Lane Fox, the co-founder of lastminute.com and a Twitter board member, paid tribute to Agrawal, Gadde and Segal, thanking them for “leading with incredible integrity and care”.</p>

<p>News of the deal, after months of legal back-and-forth, brought immediate warnings that it must not lead to a surge in hate speech and disinformation on the platform, which has more than 230 million users. Musk, a self-described “free speech absolutist”, has said he intends to bring banned users, including Donald Trump, back to the platform.</p>

<p>Trump responded to Musk’s takeover on his own platform, Truth Social, on Friday, stating he is “very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands”. “Twitter must now work hard to rid itself of all the bots and fake accounts that have hurt it so badly,” he wrote. “I LOVE TRUTH!”</p>

<p>Musk seemed to allude to the question of whether Trump would return to the platform in a Tweet on Friday, stating that the platform would be forming “a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints” to address such issues. “No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes,” he wrote.</p>

<p>Thierry Breton, the European commissioner for the internal market, responded with a tweet warning that the bird “will fly by our rules” – in a reference to the EU’s Digital Services Act, which requires online platforms to tackle illegal content such as hate speech.</p>

<p>Thérèse Coffey, the UK environment secretary, said it would be “concerning” if a relaxation of content moderation led to a proliferation on hate speech on the platform. However, the UK’s online safety bill, which targets hate speech among other types of harmful content, has been placed on pause again after Rishi Sunak’s appointment as prime minister.</p>

<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, tweeted: “Any decision about allowing suspended users to return must be taken incredibly carefully & in direct consultation with experts in countering digital hate & misinformation.”</p>

<p>One internet safety campaigner said on Friday that the deal could “unravel” Twitter’s work on improving the platform, after reports that Gadde had been fired.</p>

<p>Seyi Akiwowo, the head of Glitch, a UK-based charity that campaigns against online abuse, said Gadde’s removal was a blow. She tweeted: “I am very concerned that the progress Twitter has finally made on safety over the last 6 years will unravel in the next few weeks.”</p>

<p>In the US, the first amendment campaign group Pen America said the midterm elections on 8 November would be a “pivotal” moment for the platform, showing whether Musk has grasped the intricacies of its operations.</p>

<p>“With the election two weeks out a pivotal indicator will be whether purveyors of disinformation are given free rein to mislead people over Twitter about when, where and how to vote,” said Suzanne Nossel, the organisation’s chief executive.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Musk attempted to play down concerns over harmful content. In a message to Twitter’s advertising clients, he said turning the site into a “hellscape” would not work. He tweeted that the platform “obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape” and the platform must be “warm and welcoming to all”.</p>

<p>However, Musk’s very first public statement on Friday morning was to promise the pseudonymous Maga influencer “Catturd” that he would be “digging in” to why the user’s account is “shadowbanned” – a reference to it not showing up in search results. With 850,000 followers, the account is one of the more prominent on the US right.</p>

<p>Musk, who is worth $212bn, has committed to financing most of the transaction himself, although he has received commitments worth more than $7bn from investors including Larry Ellison, founder of the Oracle software group, and the cryptocurrency platform Binance. The deal will also be backed by a $13bn debt package led by a consortium of Wall Street banks.</p>

<p>Immediate termination of the three Twitter executives’ employment could cost the company more than $120m. Under “golden parachute” clauses Agrawal, Segal and Gadde would all qualify for lucrative payouts to cover previous share awards, plus a year’s salary and some insurance benefits. Agrawal would be entitled to total payments of $57.4m, and Segal and Gadde $44.5m and $20m respectively.</p>

<p>They also hold shares worth $8.3m, $22m and $34.8m respectively. Those shares are likely to be bought by Musk during the takeover. The closure of the deal will also trigger payments for Twitter’s US investment bankers that were conditional on completion of the takeover. JP Morgan Chase will receive $48m and Goldman Sachs $65m.</p>

<p>Completion of the deal brings to a close a takeover that became mired in corporate and legal drama soon after it was announced in April. Within weeks the deal, which Musk had signed on 25 April, began to founder as its prospective owner raised concerns about the number of vexatious spam accounts on the platform.</p>

<p>This led the Tesla chief executive to announce in July that he was walking away from the transaction.</p>

<p>Twitter then sued Musk in the US state of Delaware, where the company is incorporated, to demand that he close the deal. After a surprise change of mind by Musk as a court date approached, a Delaware judge gave both sides until 5pm on 28 October to close the deal.</p>


<h2 id="1596798773441588775">Britain’s first Hindu prime minister is destroying Tories’ pitiful vision of diversity | Pankaj Mishra</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The world has watched in appalled fascination as the UK’s ruling party scrapes the bottom of its human resources barrel: it found there its first Black chancellor of the exchequer and then, to clear up his mess, its first Hindu prime minister. Yet exultant noises from India as well as Britain would make us believe that some historic milestone has been reached.</p>

<p>Hindu supremacists have pounced on the possibility that Rishi Sunak, a self-proclaimed devout Hindu, is a desi bro, even an undercover agent of the “Global Indian Takeover” – the title of a once regular feature in the Times of India. Evidently, he observes upper-caste taboos against beef and alcohol and always keeps his statuette of Ganesha, the guarantor of worldly success, close to him. “Indian son rises over the empire” was one typical headline in India this week.</p>

<p>Never mind that Sunak’s carefully trimmed career pathways to plutocratic chic make him resemble a human pinstripe rather more than the devout Hindu in loincloth – Mahatma Gandhi – who helped the sun set on the British empire. Sunak’s deeper pieties are revealed by his professional choices: credential-stockpiling and network-formation at Winchester, Oxford (PPE) and Stanford (MBA), stints at Goldman Sachs, and then bank-raiding and tax-dodging hedge fund firms, directorship of his billionaire father-in-law’s investment company, a US green card and eager membership of a traditionally nasty political party.</p>

<p>His hasty promotion to 10 Downing Street now emboldens insolent racists to present themselves as the purveyor of racial diversity, and to scoff at Labour’s nearly immaculate frontbench whiteness. Such opportunistic political correctness is validated by a Labour leadership that is quick to reprimand those who discount Sunak as a “win for Asian representation”. Hollow notions of social diversity and racial justice are further affirmed by members of a non-white intelligentsia, who have been trained by the ideology of meritocracy to see success and power, no matter how dubiously achieved or brief, as the measure of all things.</p>

<p>A columnist in the Financial Times this week wrote: “As a British Asian of the same generation, intense feelings overwhelm me when I see Rishi Sunak cross the door into 10 Downing Street.” The same writer had, while celebrating Liz Truss’s “diverse” cabinet, reverently recited the first names of recent British chancellors – “Kwasi, Nadhim, Rishi, Sajid” – and then added: “This is to say nothing of Kemi and Ranil, of Alok and Suella.”</p>

<p>And, presumably, Priti, another Tory daughter of immigrants who seemed as keen as Suella to fulfil the dreams of Enoch Powell. As it happens, the first Hindu prime minister is destroying, more rapidly and comprehensively than Boris Johnson’s and Liz Truss’s diverse cabinets, the pitiful visions of diversity relaunched by his coronation. Sunak’s immediate resurrection of the disgraced Braverman tells us that we should quickly abandon wishful thinking in order to be truly ready for Rishi.</p>

<p>True readiness for such overpromoted Tory desis will consist in recognising that collaboration with white ruling classes or political passivity rather than struggles for social justice largely defines the history of the Indian diaspora, especially of its highly educated and upper-caste members. The over-zealous persecutors of refugees and the “tofu wokerati” today resemble, disturbingly, the Indian immigrants in A Bend in the River, VS Naipaul’s novel about decolonsing east Africa, who regard their Black and brown compatriots as the losers of history and escape to London to join its white winners. As one character sums up his bleak hyper-individualistic ethic: “The world is a rich place. It all depends on what you choose in it … I know exactly who I am and where I stand in the world. But now I want to win and win and win.”</p>

<p>Winning was always easier for a people who spoke English relatively well and avoided political conflict while pursuing their obsessions with educational achievement and social mobility. While the Chinese diaspora, the world’s largest, remains less visible, many Indians in the west have steadily improved their prospects, becoming, as the 1980s arrived, poster people for the neoliberal ideology of meritocracy – the “model minority”.</p>

<p>Even as Sunak’s Punjabi middle-class parents sent him to Winchester, such far-right political office-bearers of Punjabi origin as Nikki Haley and Bobby Jindal started to sing in the US from Ronald Reagan’s songsheet about hard work and dreams. In particular, twice-migrants, such as Patel’s and Sunak’s families, have been much better placed than any diasporic community to benefit from three decades of neoliberal globalisation under American and British auspices.</p>

<p>These proto-globalisers were helped at the same time by fresh personal and professional networks with a “New India” that swiftly discarded its pretensions to Gandhian values while rushing to embrace power and wealth. Sunak, now married to a Indian citizen richer than King Charles, shares his glossy biography with many men (and some women) of Indian ancestry who today own the world’s biggest industries and run major banks, hedge funds and Silicon Valley companies.</p>

<p>Many of these still strangely unexamined winners of globalisation have assumed power-broking positions in several countries. Take, for instance, the Gupta brothers, who managed to get South Africa’s ruling party on their payroll and nearly ruined the country’s economy. Sunak, whose in-laws’ company Infosys has made more than $120m in public sector deals in Britain since he entered government, belongs to this serenely diverse global plutocracy rather than any community demanding reparative justice for damages sustained in the white man’s world.</p>

<p>What’s truly unprecedented about the new occupant of 10 Downing Street – who held on to his green card while living next door with his then-non-dom wife to Boris Johnson, and who owns a penthouse in Santa Monica, and may soon jet off to sunny California – is not his showy Hinduism or brown skin, but his multiple identities as a ferociously networked transnational that allow him to operate simultaneously in several countries..</p>

<p>That this “citizen of everywhere”, a devout Hindu in a tie and cashmere hoodie, should now be chosen to mollify financial markets and caress the Brexit fantasy of absolute sovereignty says a great deal about the ideological dementia of the Tory party. The turd-polishing abilities of centrist-Dad liberalism, too, are in plainer sight as the logrollers of the BBC, Times and Financial Times work hard to present merciless enforcers of austerity as “grown-up moderates”. But we should be in no doubt about what an immoral and inept political class wants us to celebrate: “Asian representation” leading a cruel Tory programme of mass impoverishment.

<h2 id="278697997273882133">Jerry Lee Lewis: a thrilling one-of-a-kind showman who was mired in scandal</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>In October 1973, Jerry Lee Lewis was booked to play a showcase gig at the Roxy, a newly opened LA club that immediately attracted a clientele heavy on rock stars: among its co-owners were David Geffen, Neil Young’s manager, Elliot Roberts, and the famed producer Lou Adler. Lewis was, in theory at least, in the throes of another comeback. He had just completed work on an album called The Session, recorded in London with an all-star backing band: Kenney Jones of the Faces, Rory Gallagher and Peter Frampton among them. By all accounts the sessions hadn’t gone terribly well. Propped up by booze and amphetamines, Lewis’s behavior was volatile: Rory Gallagher recalled that whenever something displeased him, Lewis would reach for his sock, where, it was believed, he concealed a gun. Still, the combined contemporary star power of his guests helped the album to Lewis’s highest US chart placing in a decade.</p>

<p>But if Lewis was pleased about the attention paid to him by a younger generation of musicians, he had a funny way of showing it: when John Lennon walked into the Roxy that night, Lewis stopped playing and began berating him from the stage: “[he] started on about how the Beatles were shit and the Stones were shit and there ain’t nobody could play real rock’n’roll the way Jerry Lee could,” recalled Gallagher. For his part, Lennon seemed entirely unbothered. After the show, he walked into Lewis’s dressing room, dropped to his knees and kissed his feet, before asking for an autograph from the man he called “the real king of rock’n’roll”.</p>

<p>It’s an incident that tells you something about Jerry Lee Lewis himself, but a lot more about the kind of reverence in which he was held by people who could remember the impact of his early singles. Sixty years on, it’s hard to imagine what music as feral and raw as Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On or Great Balls Of Fire must have sounded like to a kid in late-50s Britain, not that long after rationing had. Just a year before, pop music had meant Doris Day and Ronnie Hilton and Winifred Atwell: it was cosy light entertainment, aimed at adults, who’d lived through the second world war and wanted a quiet life. But now it meant this: a man who appeared to be genuinely unhinged – who had apparently earned the nickname “The Killer” after he attempted to strangle one of his high school teachers with his own tie – kicking his stool away, pounding the keyboard with his heel and leaping on top of the piano, playing music that was intense, visceral, sexual and completely incomprehensible to anyone over the age of 20, the sound of a generation gap being torn open. But you can get an idea from the way musicians who were kids then behaved around Jerry Lee Lewis decades later. John Lennon kissed his feet; when Elton John – who happily admitted his debt to Lewis’s playing and his brand of showmanship – was finally ushered into Lewis’s presence backstage at a US festival in 2015, he was, it was reported, visibly shaking with nerves.</p>

<p>It’s tempting to say that the music he recorded at Sun Studios between 1956 and 57 was so potent and impactful that it rendered Lewis weirdly bulletproof. That’s certainly one explanation of how he survived enough personal scandal to destroy anyone else’s career several times over. As the journalist Nick Kent noted, Nick Tosches’ masterly Lewis biography Hellfire was a book in which “havoc inevitably reigns: in-laws go mad or become accident statistics, offspring die horrible, mangled deaths, wives drown or suffer inexplicable fatal overdoses … record people are terrorized, audiences verbally and physically attacked, promoters bankrupted, journalists threatened with broken bottles … while The Killer just keeps on rocking”.</p>

<p>He liked to tell people he had served his musical apprenticeship in a juke joint in his home town of Ferriday, Louisiana, called Haney’s Big House: “the evilest, baddest, lowest fighting– and –killingest place on Earth”. What he learned there is a moot point. The sound of raw black rhythm and blues ran through his playing, but Lewis was never big on naming his influences, although he would occasionally confess a fondness for Moon Mullican, the self-styled “King Of The Hillbilly Piano Players” who claimed his music could “make them goddam beer bottles bounce on the table”. If he thought he was going to follow Mullican’s career path, however, he was mistaken: before he fetched up at Sam Phillips’s Sun Studios, Lewis moved to Nashville, but was rejected by every bastion of country music, including the Grand Ole Opry and the Louisiana Hayride.</p>

<p>But he fitted perfectly into the febrile, risk-taking atmosphere of Sun’s golden age. A blues fan, Sam Phillips had started out largely recording black performers, but having discovered Elvis Presley, increasingly concentrated on artists who muddied the boundaries between R&B, country and hillbilly music. It was at Sun that Lewis’s mercurial unpredictability was noticed by Phillips, who responded by simply keeping the tapes running until something happened – these were the circumstances in which Whole Lotta Shakin’ Going On was captured – and it was at Sun that the stage-shy Lewis was encouraged to put on more of a show by his label mates Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, advice he ran with in no uncertain terms. It took one frenzied appearance amid the comedians and variety acts on Steve Allen’s Sunday night TV show to turn Lewis into a national star, but he worked incessantly, taping a phenomenal quantity of music in a short space of time: in addition to his own recordings, he added piano to tracks by Perkins and Billy Lee Riley, changing the sound of rockabilly in the process. It was as if, for all his bluster – and Lewis was never reserved when it came to proclaiming his singular genius – Lewis thought his time in the spotlight might be short-lived. For one thing, rock’n’roll was still thought of as a passing fad. And then there was Johnny Cash’s theory: the God-fearing Lewis was tormented by the belief his music was sinful and leading both him and his audience to eternal damnation.</p>

<p>In the end, it was something more prosaic that did for him: the discovery by the British press in 1958 that he had married his 13-year-old cousin Myra Gale Brown. The reality was even more shocking. Lewis was also a bigamist: his divorce from his second wife, Jane Mitchum, had not been finalized when he married Brown, just as his divorce from his first wife, Dorothy Barton, had not been finalized when he married Mitchum. In the aftermath of the scandal, his career plummeted. Lewis scored a solitary hit single in 1961, a cover of Ray Charles’s What’d I Say, but his records were blacklisted, and the fees he could command for live performances slashed: “He went from making $100 a week to $100,000 a week and right back again,” noted Adam Fields, the producer of the 1989 Lewis biopic Great Balls of Fire, “and I don’t think he’s ever understood why.” He changed labels, and made records under pseudonyms to little effect, his woes compounded by changing tastes and the arrival of the British Invasion.</p>

<p>At his lowest point in 1964, a German producer taped his performance backed by the Nashville Teens at Hamburg’s Live at the Star Club, ironically one of the Beatles’ pre-fame haunts. Roughly recorded, it captured the astonishing sound of Lewis with his back against the wall. Audibly accelerated by something – whether rage, bitterness or chemicals – it’s a performance of scarcely believable ferocity: from the first note, the backing musicians struggle to keep up with him. The end result is undoubtedly the greatest album Lewis ever put his name to. It may well also be the greatest live album ever made or the greatest rock’n’roll album of all time: whichever you choose, it’s an implausibly thrilling listen.</p>

<p>But it did nothing to help his cause back home: Live at the Star Club wasn’t even released in the US. Instead, he resurrected his career by concentrating on the country music that had always formed part of his repertoire: even amid the madness of the Star Club performance, he found time to play Hank Williams’s Your Cheatin’ Heart. His country recordings were tough and sparse, at odds with the late-60s trend for slickness. They were also hugely successful: cannily repackaged, even country tracks he’d cut in the 50s at Sun became belated hits. He was invited to the Grand Ole Opry and, clearly still stung by the memory of his earlier rejection, gave a spectacularly disdainful performance, ignoring demands that he avoid his rock’n’roll songs, performing for 40 minutes instead of his allotted eight, and announcing to the audience that he was “a rock’n’rolling, country and western, rhythm and blues singing motherfucker”. He was not asked back.</p>

<p>Lewis spent the rest of his life alternating between country and rock’n’roll, the latter frequently at the behest of artists at least a generation younger than him: his hit 2006 album Last Man Standing saw him duetting with an all-star cast that included Mick Jagger, Bruce Springsteen, Jimmy Page and Rod Stewart, a formula its follow-up, Mean Old Man repeated. His personal life remained as terrifyingly chaotic as ever. At his 41st birthday party in 1976, he shot his bass player, Norman Owens, apparently by accident: later the same year, he was arrested outside Elvis Presley’s home Graceland after drunkenly crashing his car – which had a loaded gun on its dashboard – into the gates. He was plagued by health issues: in 1981, a ruptured stomach nearly killed him. A 1984 Rolling Stone investigation baldly accused him of abusing his fourth wife, Jaren Gunn, and of having some involvement in the death of his fifth, Shawn Stephens, although the allegations were unverified. Then there was the saga of his cousin Jimmy Swaggart, the televangelist who became embroiled in sex scandals involving prostitutes: “we all got our urges,” offered Lewis in his defence.</p>

<p>Somehow, Lewis’s career kept going: he even seemed to find some kind of stability towards the end of his life, with his seventh wife Judith Brown, although his ability to terrify interviewers remained fully intact. He released records intermittently, but remained a huge draw live. By 2019, he was one of the last living links to the 50s rock’n’roll explosion still regularly performing, although he would doubtless have told you that he was without peer even when the rest of them were alive. “There ain’t never been anyone as good as me,” he said in the late 80s. “There ain’t never been anyone who could cut me, boy.” Certainly, there was never anyone like him, although plenty of artists followed in his wake, either energized by the astonishing music he made in the 1950s, or hypnotized by his stage presence, or seduced by the notion of the rock star as a terrifying, ungovernable force of nature, a notion he more or less invented. “I don’t have nothing to prove to nobody,” he once noted. “I just like to kick ass is all.”</p>


<h2 id="1480316505275546813">Jerry Lee Lewis, notorious US rock’n’roll star, dies aged 87</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Jerry Lee Lewis, the rock’n’roll pioneer who became one of the most infamous figures in popular music, has died aged 87, his publicist has said.</p>

<p>He died of natural causes at his home in DeSoto County, Mississippi. “Judith, his seventh wife, was by his side when he passed away at his home in Desoto County, Mississippi, south of Memphis,” a statement said. “He told her, in his final days, that he welcomed the hereafter, and that he was not afraid.”</p>

<p>Lewis’s energetic performances on songs including Great Balls of Fire helped install rock’n’roll as the dominant American pop music of the 1950s. He was born in Louisiana in 1935, the son of a poor farming family who mortgaged their home to buy Lewis his first piano. While learning the instrument and studying at an evangelical school, he was kicked out for performing a boogie-woogie version of My God is Real that was deemed irreverent.</p>

<p>He didn’t return to education, and began playing live – his first performance at the age of 14 was at the opening of a car dealership. He developed a theatrical, boisterous style that chimed with the energy of the nascent rock’n’roll scene, and began playing at Sun Studios in Memphis, first as a studio musician and then as a solo artist. Some of his earliest recordings were made in 1956 with Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Carl Perkins, a group later dubbed the Million Dollar Quartet. It was an impromptu session: Cash and Presley happened to be separately visiting the studio where Lewis was backing Perkins on piano.</p>

<p>Lewis’s breakthrough came the following year, with Whole Lotta Shakin’ Goin’ On, a barnstorming piano-driven rock’n’roll single. When he performed it on television on The Steve Allen Show, he brought his unique playing style to national attention: wildly energetic, he would kick over his piano stool and play standing up, with songs accentuated with cascading runs of notes.</p>

<p>He followed that Top 3 song with his greatest success, Great Balls of Fire, which reached No 2 on the US charts and became one of the definitive songs of the rock’n’roll era.</p>

<p>During a 1958 UK tour at the peak of his fame, he was embroiled in scandal after it was revealed he had married his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Brown – it would be the third of his seven marriages. There was outrage in the British press and the rest of his tour was cancelled. US radio stations and concert promoters also blacklisted him, and his popularity faded. He never again had a US Top 20 hit.</p>

<p>Lewis’ wild-man reputation cemented his nickname, The Killer, earned from his habit of describing acquaintances with the Louisiana slang of “killer”. After a 13-year marriage to Brown, his fourth and fifth marriages were even more notorious. Jaren Pate and Shawn Stephens both died in suspicious circumstances – the former by drowning, while there were domestic abuse rumors surrounding the latter.</p>

<p>Despite the controversies, he successfully switched to country music after the rock’n’roll scene dwindled and scored a series of hits on the US country charts, including his version of the standard Chantilly Lace.</p>

<p>In 1984, following years of prescription drug use, he survived an operation to remove a third of his stomach after a series of perforated ulcers, and in 1986, he was one of the first 10 performers inducted into the Rock’n’Roll Hall of Fame, alongside Presley, Chuck Berry and others.</p>

<p>Another infamous “Killer” moment involved Berry. When the pair were on tour, Lewis objected to Berry going on after him, and so set his piano on fire following his performance with the words: “Follow that, boy.” Meanwhile, Lewis was arrested in 1976 after he turned up drunk at Presley’s Graceland home in Memphis with a loaded pistol on the dashboard of his car.</p>

<p>Two of Lewis’s six children, died young: Steve Allen Lewis drowned in a swimming pool aged three, while Jerry Lee Lewis Jr – who had played drums for his father – died in a car accident aged 19. Four others – Ronnie Guy, Phoebe Allen, Lori Lee and Jerry Lee III – survive him, as does his wife Judith.</p>

<p>Lewis recorded 40 studio albums, the most recent being Rock & Roll Time in 2014. His previous album, Mean Old Man, reached the US Top 30 on its release in 2010 and featured duets with stars including Mick Jagger, Sheryl Crow, Willie Nelson and Eric Clapton.</p>

<p>Tributes have been arriving on social media, including from Elton John who tweeted: “Without Jerry Lee Lewis, I wouldn’t have become who I am today. He was groundbreaking and exciting, and he pulverized the piano. A brilliant singer too. Thank you for your trailblazing inspiration and all the rock ‘n’ roll memories.”</p>

<p>Ringo Starr has also tweeted: “God bless Jerry lee Lewis peace and love to all his family”. Gene Simmons called him “one of the pioneers of rock ‘n’ roll” and “a rebel to the end”.</p>

<h2 id="2304753531947788017">World close to ‘irreversible’ climate breakdown, warn major studies</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The climate crisis has reached a “really bleak moment”, one of the world’s leading climate scientists has said, after a slew of major reports laid bare how close the planet is to catastrophe.</p>

<p>Collective action is needed by the world’s nations more now than at any point since the second world war to avoid climate tipping points, Prof Johan Rockström said, but geopolitical tensions are at a high.</p>

<p>He said the world was coming “very, very close to irreversible changes … time is really running out very, very fast”.</p>

<p>Emissions must fall by about half by 2030 to meet the internationally agreed target of 1.5C of heating but are still rising, the reports showed – at a time when oil giants are making astronomical amounts of money.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Shell and TotalEnergies both doubled their quarterly profits to about $10bn. Oil and gas giants have enjoyed soaring profits as post-Covid demand jumps and after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The sector is expected to amass $4tn in 2022, strengthening calls for heavy windfall taxes to address the cost of living crisis and fund the clean energy transition.</p>

<p>All three of the key UN agencies have produced damning reports in the last two days. The UN environment agency’s report found there was “no credible pathway to 1.5C in place” and that “woefully inadequate” progress on cutting carbon emissions means the only way to limit the worst impacts of the climate crisis is a “rapid transformation of societies”.</p>

<p>Current pledges for action by 2030, even if delivered in full, would mean a rise in global heating of about 2.5C, a level that would condemn the world to catastrophic climate breakdown, according to the UN’s climate agency. Only a handful of countries have ramped up their plans in the last year, despite having promised to do so at the Cop26 UN climate summit in Glasgow last November.</p>

<p>The UN’s meteorological agency reported that all the main heating gases hit record highs in 2021, with an alarming surge in emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.</p>

<p>Separately, the IEA’s world energy report offered a glimmer of progress, that CO2 from fossil fuels could peak by 2025 as high energy prices push nations towards clean energy, though it warned that it would not be enough to avoid severe climate impacts.</p>

<p>Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, said: “It’s a really bleak moment, not only because of the reports showing that emissions are still rising, so we’re not delivering on either the Paris or Glasgow climate agreements, but we also have so much scientific evidence that we are very, very close to irreversible changes – we’re coming closer to tipping points.”</p>

<p>Research by Rockström and colleagues, published in September, found five dangerous climate tipping points may already have been passed due to the global heating caused by humanity to date, including the collapse of Greenland’s ice cap, with another five possible with 1.5C of heating.</p>

<p>“Furthermore, the world is unfortunately in a geopolitically unstable state,” said Rockström. “So when we need collective action at the global level, probably more than ever since the second world war, to keep the planet stable, we have an all-time low in terms of our ability to collectively act together.”</p>

<p>“Time is really running out very, very fast,” he said. “I must say, in my professional life as a climate scientist, this is a low point. The window for 1.5C is shutting as I speak, so it’s really tough.”</p>

<p>His remarks came after the UN secretary general, António Guterres, said on Wednesday that climate action was “falling pitifully short”. “We are headed for a global catastrophe [and] for economy-destroying levels of global heating.”</p>

<p>He added: “Droughts, floods, storms and wildfires are devastating lives and livelihoods across the globe [and] getting worse by the day. We need climate action on all fronts and we need it now.” He said the G20 nations, responsible for 80% of emissions, must lead the way.</p>

<p>Inger Andersen, head of the UN environment programme (UNEP), told the Guardian that the energy crisis must be used to speed up delivery of a low-carbon economy: “We are in danger of missing the opportunity and a crisis is a terrible thing to waste.”</p>

<p>Prof Corinne Le Quéré, at the University of East Anglia, UK, said: “It is fundamental to avoid cascading risks that responses to existing crises are made in a way that limits climate change to the lowest possible level.”</p>

<p>Further reports published in the last two days said the health of the world’s people is at the mercy of a global addiction to fossil fuels, with increasing heat deaths, hunger and infectious disease as the climate crisis intensifies.</p>

<p>In the UK, the government was accused of a “severe dereliction of duty” in leaving critical UK infrastructure at risk to climate impacts. The new prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will not attend COP27, his spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>High gas and oil prices delivered huge profits to Shell and TotalEnergies on Wednesday, which booked $9.5bn and $9.9bn respectively. Shell said it would not pay any UK-imposed windfall tax this year as the profits were being offset against investment in North Sea fields.</p>

<p>The fossil fuel industry as a whole amassed $4tn in 2022, according to another new report from International Energy Agency (IEA), a sum that could otherwise transform climate action.</p>

<p>The IEA report said: “Net income for the world’s oil and gas producers is set to double in 2022 to an unprecedented $4tn, a huge $2tn windfall.” The oil and gas sector has gained an average of $1tn a year in unearned profits for the last 50 years.</p>

<p>The IEA said clean energy investment would have to be at least $4tn a year by 2030 to hit net zero emissions by mid-century. “If the global oil and gas industry were to invest this [$2tn] additional income in low‐emissions fuels, such as hydrogen and biofuels, it would fund all of the investment needed in these fuels for the remainder of this decade.”</p>

<p>Prof Myles Allen, at the University of Oxford, said: “The combined profits, taxes and royalties generated by the oil and gas industry over the past few months would be enough to capture every single molecule of CO2 produced by their activities and reinject it back underground. So why are we only talking about transforming society and not about obliging a highly profitable industry to clean up the mess caused by the products it sells?”</p>

<p>“The situation is serious and bleak,” said Prof Simon Lewis, at University College London. “Shell has made £26bn profit this year, carbon emissions are back at pre-pandemic levels, while 53,000 people died of heat stress in Europe in the summer, and floods have displaced millions from Nigeria to Pakistan. The solution is to do everything we can to defeat the fossil fuel industry – they stand between us all and a prosperous future.”</p>

<p>Rockström was pessimistic about any breakthrough in the speed of climate action at the Cop27 climate summit, which he said would be dominated by nations such as Pakistan demanding funding to rebuild their countries after climate disasters. Rich, high-emitting nations have long rejected such claims, fearing unlimited liabilities.</p>

<p>“This is a necessary discussion,” Rockström said. “But it leads to a deeper rift between the global north and the south. And that’s exactly what we do not need now.”</p>

<p>But he said progress could be made within a few years: “The Ukraine war is the nail in the coffin for the fossil-fuel-driven advanced economies. In the short term, it costs us a lot and we lose speed on climate action.” But in the longer term, he said, the energy and food crises add national security to the planetary and health reasons for climate action.</p>

<p>Prof Michael Mann, at the University of Pennsylvania in the US, said it was important to note that progress was being made: “More work clearly needs to be done if warming is to be kept below 1.5C, but nobody foresaw the major policy progress in recent months in both Australia and the US. It is estimated that the US legislation will lower national emissions by 40% this decade. With US leadership, we can expect other major emitters to now come to the table at Cop27.”</p>

<p>Climate experts agree that every action that limits global heating reduces the suffering endured by people from climate impacts. “The 1.5C target is now near impossible, but every fraction of a degree will equate to massive avoided damages for generations to come,” said Prof Dave Reay, at the University of Edinburgh, UK.</p>

<p>Röckstrom said: “Despite the fact that the situation is depressing and very challenging, I would strongly advise everyone to act in business or policy or society or science. The deeper we fall into the dark abyss of risk, the more we have to make efforts to climb out of that hole. It’s not as if we don’t know what to do – it’s rather that we’re not doing what is necessary.”</p>


<h2 id="283014321121387529">My lover says he can’t leave his wife for me. Is he being dishonest? | Ask Annalisa Barbieri</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I’ve been having an affair for three months with my co-worker, who is married with a two-year-old. I never thought it would get this far but we have been seeing each other a lot and have developed feelings for each other. When it began, I was conscious that men never leave the wife for the mistress, but as we continued I’ve really started seeing how strongly he feels for me and I for him.</p>

<p>He says he’s always thinking about me, misses me, cannot enjoy his time at home any longer, and just longs to be with me. We finally had the talk a few days ago, and he said he cannot leave his wife right now as we’ve been seeing each other for too short a time (they’ve been together for 11 years). He says he is bored with her and wants to be with me, but he can’t leave his daughter. (I have made it clear I would never ask him to give her up.)</p>

<p>I know this is the stuff that married men always tell people they have affairs with, but he seems truly honest, though he refuses to go to therapy as he is too scared; and I will finish working at the same firm in a couple of months. I haven’t felt this strongly about anybody in a long time, but the fact that he thinks three months is too short a time to make a decision, and he’d rather stay in an unhappy marriage rather than face reality, makes me think he is not being honest with me.</p>

<p>I actually think him saying he hasn’t known you for long enough, although rather skewed logic, is the honest bit. I think the rest of it shows some delusion on his part and yours. While of course there are exceptions, experience has taught me to pay heed to how people go into relationships – for it’s often how they exit them too (in this case, starting another affair).</p>

<p>I went to psychotherapist Fe Robinson (psychotherapy.org.uk), who said: “Initially, you knew it was a fling and I’m really curious: at that stage, what did you want from it? Was it just a bit of fun? You were attracted to this man who you knew wasn’t available, which makes me wonder about your emotional availability, because it doesn’t sound as if he concealed his unavailability.”</p>

<p>The reason this is important is that often, but not always, people go for unavailable people – however subconsciously – if they want to keep a relationship on a “fantasy” level. It doesn’t seem as if your time together has been about real, ordinary, boring life. No wonder your relationship compares so unfavourably with that with his wife. As Robinson pointed out: “This isn’t going to suddenly become simpler if he leaves his wife, but very much more complicated. You’d potentially be managing an aggrieved ex-wife and you’d be stepmother to his young child.”</p>

<p>Robinson further noted: “Even if he were available, three months is a really short time to make a decision about a life partner. We don’t really know someone yet; we’re still at that heady hormonal rush stage. Especially if it’s an affair, because you will have had less time together.”</p>

<p>But there’s another thing to think about here, beyond the dishonesty to his wife and, very probably, to you too. “Do you want,” asked Robinson, “to be with someone whose style of dealing with problems is to have an affair instead of working it through? You say he won’t face reality, but whose reality?”</p>

<p>It’s possible for people to have very strong feelings for more than one person, and in Robinson’s experience, added: “People have affairs for lots of reasons; it doesn’t always mean they want to leave their main relationship.”</p>

<p>You didn’t tell me your age. I’ve seen many people waste time waiting for their married “partner” to make up their minds, with the other person putting what they want on the back burner. What do you want? Was an unavailable, dishonest man on your wish list? I’m sorry to sound harsh, but it’s because I think you deserve someone more available to you.</p>

<p>I understand about finding yourself somewhere you didn’t plan to be, but you’re here and you’ve written to me. He won’t be in a rush to do anything as he has the stability of his “boring” home life and the exciting mistress. I would get some distance if I were you and remember this one truth: if a man really wants to be with you, he will be.</p>

<h2 id="431847163083807529">‘I think I can improve greatly’: James Corden on inadequacy, nerves and his return to TV acting</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Even before James Corden and Jez Butterworth made Mammals, their suspenseful six-part comedy-drama series, the actor and the playwright already had a lot in common.</p>

<p>Both have won a Tony award, and recognition from the Oliviers (Corden nominated, Butterworth winning) for a triumphant London-to-Broadway transfer: Corden for the slapstick farce One Man, Two Guvnors, Butterworth for the mystically tinged thriller The Ferryman. They each have one foot in Hollywood – Corden was nominated for a Golden Globe for The Prom, in which his turn as a camp musical theatre star inflamed the debate over straight actors playing gay roles, while away from the stage Butterworth is a screenwriter whose credits include Spectre and the next Indiana Jones yarn.</p>

<p>They also grew up within 30 miles of each other. “The same bit of the clock,” says the playwright, referring to the towns and cities around the M25. Their paths first crossed much further from home. “Here’s the thing,” says Corden, sitting alongside Butterworth at the Ham Yard Hotel in London. “Jez is from St Albans, I’m from High Wycombe, and we met at the Met Ball. Which is a sentence I don’t think anyone has ever said before.” It was Corden who broke the ice that night in New York. “Jerusalem had a profound impact on my life,” he says, referring to Butterworth’s 2009 masterpiece, recently revived for another sellout West End run, with Mark Rylance as the reprobate facing eviction from his woodland caravan. “I just wanted Jez to know how much his work has meant to me.”</p>

<p>Butterworth has his own memories of the evening. “I was very much looking forward to Cher coming on because I’m a massive Cher fan,” he admits. “Then this lovely thing happened, and I bet nothing else at the Met ball that night was nearly as much fun.” Corden raises a forefinger to interject. “It might have been the night Taylor Swift met Tom Hiddleston,” he says. (It was.)</p>

<p>“It’s fun standing in the middle of the Met Gala with someone you could’ve been in double maths with,” continues Butterworth. The 53-year-old may have overlooked the fact that he is nine years Corden’s senior but his peas-in-a-pod point stands. “There’s this natural affinity when you’ve hung out at similar places on a Friday night,” agrees Corden.</p>

<p>Little can be revealed here about the show they have made together, booby-trapped as it is with shocks and twists. “Everything in Mammals after the first five minutes is spoiler,” says Butterworth. What can be said, though, is that Corden plays a chef whose personal life hits the rocks as he is launching his first restaurant. (Since the series was made, the actor has had his own public contretemps with the restaurateur Keith McNally, who first banned him from his New York bistro Balthazar for rude behaviour, then lifted the ban after Corden apologised.) Sally Hawkins co-stars as his dreamy, distracted sister. The series reflects Butterworth’s feeling that relationships “are just really funny. People find themselves endlessly occupying these positions that are completely untenable the second you look at them closely. Our own mistakes are just mistakes but when somebody else makes them and you’re the victim, it’s biblical.”</p>

<p>The score is by Blur’s Graham Coxon, the soundtrack shimmering with chansons. In one episode, Corden beats up a gravestone. Whales make a fleeting appearance. So too does Wales, in a manner of speaking, in the form of Tom Jones. Contrary to the title of one of Jones’s best-known songs, it is all very unusual. As is the sight of Corden giving a performance of impressive range. Most of the US knows him only from The Late Late Show, which he has hosted since 2015, and its spin-off phenomenon Carpool Karaoke. But despite the success of Gavin and Stacey, which he co-wrote and starred in, British audiences still regard Corden primarily as a rambunctious celebrity. He even wrote in his 2011 autobiography, May I Have Your Attention Please?, that he didn’t consider himself an actor. “Let’s not talk about my book,” he cringes now. (He claims to have hammered it out in a week.)</p>

<p>Butterworth has no truck with this. “James doesn’t exist in any context for me other than acting. We spent eight months cutting Mammals and I could have used every single bit of any take. Everything he did is so true.” Writing for Corden’s voice was “like rolling downhill. Same as it was with Mark on Jerusalem. It’s a duet with that person. It was done before I knew it, and that’s the sign that you’re off to the races.”</p>

<p>Mammals wasn’t originally tailored for Corden – the script for the first episode had been lying in a drawer for years – but their Met Ball meeting prompted Butterworth to complete it. Why the long gestation?</p>

<p>“I wait for ever to see whether things are any good or not. It’s a really simple trick, so you don’t look back on stuff you did three years ago and think: ‘I wish I hadn’t fucking done that.’” Corden, whose history of self-confessed rush-jobs includes the sketch show Horne & Corden and the film Lesbian Vampire Killers (both with Mathew Horne), nods vigorously in agreement.</p>

<p>A flashback in Mammals shows his character as a struggling grunt in another chef’s kitchen, dreaming of running his own joint. I ask Corden what he remembers about himself as a showbiz outsider looking in, back in the days before he’d made it. “What being a talkshow host for seven and a half years has taught me is that nobody thinks they’re on the inside,” he says. “Every single person feels on some level that they are an outsider looking in. We’ve had everyone come through the doors of that show and I would say that is the one common thread. Even the phrase ‘made it’ – I don’t know what that is. I think it’s impossible to make it.</p>

<p>What he does next is smart, revealing and vaguely unnerving, not to mention indicative of how he got where he is today: he angles the spotlight away from himself in a classic piece of chatshow flattery. “You,” he says, gesturing at me. “You probably had a sense at school that you could write: ‘I don’t know what this is, but I feel there’s something here I can do … ’ And now today you are an esteemed writer at arguably one of the best news sources in the world, and I don’t believe for one second that you woke up this morning and went: ‘I’ve fucking cracked it boys! Oooh yeah! Off to the Ham Yard, look out!’”</p>

<p>He’s slapping his palms together, whooping at the top of his voice. It’s quite a display. Then he switches to a gentler register: “You just don’t. And yet there will be contemporaries of yours who’ll say: ‘Well, look at Ryan, he must have it all, he must be happy!’ I honestly don’t think it exists.”</p>

<p>Point taken. “What does resonate with me is when my character says he wants his own restaurant and someone asks whether he’s good enough. And he replies: ‘No. But I will be.’ Then he explains the lengths he’s already gone to just to get where he is. That I understand. That feeling of thinking: ‘I would love to do this, and I think I can improve greatly.’ I hope I never stop improving. I hope it’s a constant long walk into the woods, and that I’ll just keep going.”</p>

<p>His tenure on The Late Late Show, however, will not. His current stint, which ends next spring, will be his last. “The only thing I knew when I took the job was that I wasn’t going to be sat there 20 years later saying: ‘Stick around everybody, we’ll be right back.’ If I’m honest I thought it’d be cancelled within six months. My wife and I rented furniture. I remember telling her: ‘The show will get cancelled.’ And I knew the last thing we’d want to deal with was: ‘How do we get rid of this sofa?’”</p>

<p>Nine Emmys later (plus a 10th in 2017 for hosting the Tony awards) and he’s finally quitting. On the horizon is the possibility of giving One Man, Two Guvnors another go round the block. “I haven’t committed to it yet,” he says. “But I wouldn’t be able to do it physically in 10 years. All I’m ever looking for is: will it be fun?” Butterworth leans over: “It’s called a play, after all,” he says.</p>

<p>Even enjoyable experiences don’t always work out. Corden had a blast making Cats, only for it to become the most maligned film since, well, Lesbian Vampire Killers. He got in on the act himself, confessing that he hadn’t seen the movie but had “heard it’s terrible”, then mocked it by appearing as a fluffy feline at the Oscars in 2020. As a parting gift, I present him with a four-star rave review of the movie by Nigel Andrews, venerable former film critic of the Financial Times, in which Corden’s performance is described as a “tour de force”. He reads it in disbelief. “Oh my God. Stop. Stop! ‘Tour de force’! I’m going to treasure this. I’m going to frame it and put it up in my bathroom.”</p>

<p>Butterworth joins in with the merriment as I gather my things to leave. Then Corden stops laughing and gazes up at me, his blue eyes sparkling. “What did you think of our show, Ryan?” he asks. “Did you like it?” His voice is soft and solicitous, his upturned face the spit of Oliver Twist. I’m rather caught off-guard; I presumed that my questions alone had conveyed enthusiasm, but apparently not. So I babble something about how much I loved the tonal shifts and Corden’s knockout performance – which is all true – and finally he looks relieved. Cats may be standoffish but superstars sometimes need their tummies rubbed.</p>

<p>Mammals is on Prime Video from Friday 11 November</p>


<h2 id="2293988016377002570">Global tuberculosis cases increase for the first time in 20 years</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The number of people infected with tuberculosis (TB) has risen globally for the first time in almost 20 years, prompting accusations that the disease has been neglected because it affects the poor.</p>

<p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 10.6 million people were diagnosed with TB in 2021, a 4.5% increase on the previous year. The number of new cases had dropped by an average of 2% most years since 2000.</p>

<p>TB-related deaths rose for the second consecutive year to 1.6 million in 2021, said the WHO yesterday. Many people were unable to get a diagnosis or receive treatment during Covid lockdowns.</p>

<p>Dr Lucica Ditiu, the executive director of the Stop TB Partnership, said: “It has become very clear that we now have a very dangerous situation on our hands with an airborne disease that is completely neglected, and which has been allowed to run rampant over the past two years.</p>

<p>“Despite this shockingly upward trend of TB mortality and infection rates, funding for fighting TB decreased in 2020 and 2021 from an already pathetically low level. This is infuriating and it makes me wonder why there is such a lack of investment for TB. Is it because governments do not care for their own people? Is it because the life of a person dying from TB is less important or is it because TB affects mainly poor people from poorer countries, and it is more comfortable to simply neglect them?”</p>

<p>Mel Spigelman, president of the TB Alliance, said Covid had diverted “scarce resources” from TB programmes and from the development of new tools to tackle the disease, including vaccines.</p>

<p>“Medical breakthroughs like effective vaccines, more powerful drug regimens and point of care TB diagnostics are desperately needed, now more than ever,” he said.</p>

<p>TB, which mostly attacks the lungs, spreads through airborne droplets. It can remain latent for many years before it causes health problems and can be difficult to diagnose.</p>

<p>The ability to control transmission is limited because the current vaccine, known as BCG, is more than 100 years old and has limited efficacy in adults, according to ProfJamie Triccas, a TB researcher at the University of Sydney.</p>

<p>Triccas said some potential vaccines have reached late-stage trials, but the funding needed to develop them isn’t there.</p>

<p>According to a December 2021 report by the Treatment Action Group and the Stop TB Partnership, the total amount of global funding for tuberculosis research was $915m in 2020 – far below the $2bn goal set by the UN in 2018. Of that total, 13% of it was spent on vaccine research, while billions were invested in Covid vaccines.</p>

<p>“It is perhaps the quintessential disease of poverty and therefore does not have the political pressure and financial incentives behind it that do diseases that affect the more affluent parts of global society,” said Spigelman.</p>

<p>According to the WHO’s annual Global TB Report, there has been decline in global spending on essential TB services from $6bn in 2019 to $5.4bn in 2021, which is less than half of the global target of $13bn.</p>

<p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director general, said: “If the pandemic has taught us anything, it’s that with solidarity, determination, innovation and the equitable use of tools, we can overcome severe health threats. Let’s apply those lessons to tuberculosis.”</p>

<p>The main source of international funding for TB is through the Global Fund to Fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which last month received $14.25bn of the $18bn it wanted to fund its work for the next three years. The UK failed to commit any money.</p>


<h2 id="1486446862576985606">‘I think about death 35 times a day’: Bill Nighy on sex, social media – and still being able to manage the stairs</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>So far, Bill Nighy has been offered a seat on the tube on 10 separate occasions. “Not that I’m counting. But obviously I am.” He snorts. “The worst thing is everyone in the carriage turns to look and see what you say.”</p>

<p>Always a polite decline. “Last week, I was carrying my gym bag and I felt like saying: ‘You know, I’ve just been doing quite vigorous things. And I can actually remain upright for quite long periods of time.’”</p>

<p>He snorts again: the signature Nighy sound, unmistakable as a chiffchaff. It’s the same with stairs, he sighs; he’s forever being steered towards the lift. “The first couple of times, I couldn’t understand it. ‘Are the stairs … unsafe? Oh! Stairs! Am I OK with the stairs? Yeah, stairs are OK. I’m not bad on the stairs, y’know.’”</p>

<p>Does Nighy look in urgent need of a sit-down? Or are people just really keen to offer? Here, after all, is one of the world’s few actual rock star actors. “He has a brand,” says his latest director, Oliver Hermanus. “A singular type of British cool.”</p>

<p>His hangdog sex-god languor remains immaculate, regardless of the squid (Pirates of the Caribbean) or ninny (Emma), naff has-been (Love, Actually) or withered civil servant (his new one, Living) he’s currently playing.</p>

<p>Spend any time in Pimlico and you’re all but guaranteed a sighting. Navy Dunhill suit, Cutler and Gross specs, suave and obliging for the selfies. His appeal was never predicated on plump youth. And, at 72, he’s still whippet-thin: vigorous things, plus a strict regime of restaurant-only dining and a bare fridge.</p>

<p>How did he cope in lockdown? Ah, he smiles. He rented an Airbnb in the Suffolk countryside near his family (ex Diana Quick, their daughter, Mary, her two children) and the woman who ran it asked if he’d like her to cook for him. “I said: ‘I would love you to cook for me … ’”</p>

<p>Small wonder he assumes people leap to their feet at the sight of him because he looks so decrepit. He recently had his cataracts done. “When you remove the bandages, then you see how old you are. I thought: ‘Oh! That’s why people behave so weirdly around me.’ Because I had been living behind, y’know, quite a serious film.”</p>

<p>Again, mostly his own neuroses. He’s long been allergic to his face. No looking at photos, or films, or interviews. “I gave it up because – as a practical thing – I have to go to work. I can’t have all that rolling around in my head. So I don’t keep track. But then occasionally I’ll catch a glimpse of myself. And you go: ‘Jesus, God almighty. Wow.’”</p>

<p>He keels gently in his chair. We’re in Soho and Nighy has water with ice and a fat wedge of lime. He hasn’t drunk alcohol since 17 May 1992 – that hard-living history fuels the louche vibes – and, perhaps to compensate, always seems to style up the mundane.</p>

<p>Shooting The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India in 2015, he took his own Yorkshire teabags and decanted Marmite into 30 tiny tubs to evade airport security. Behaviour that might seem mad from anyone else, but is transformed by Nighy into the height of aestheticism.</p>

<p>Shooting their new film in Mayfair last year, says co-star Aimee Lou Wood, he “somehow managed to source a table, chairs and beautiful Italian dinner for us seemingly out of nowhere. There was even a bit of table decoration. We sat eating arrabbiata in the middle of a busy London street while people walked past and waved.”</p>

<p>That film is Living, tailor-made for Nighy by its scriptwriter Kazuo Ishiguro, who asked if he might like to star in a remake of Kurosawa’s Ikiru. He would; it’s now his first proper shot at an Oscar. Nighy plays Mr Williams, a widower who oversees an office of paper-shufflers in post-war County Hall. A doctor tells him he has stomach cancer and six months to live. So he starts trying to do so, helped by a boozy playwright (Tom Burke) met on a botched suicide trip to the seaside, as well as Wood’s waitress and a sunny civil servant played by Alex Sharp.</p>

<p>What drew Ishiguro to Nighy, the former emails, was “his ability to arouse, seemingly at will, not only an audience’s emotions, but also its affection”. That makes Nighy “unique among his generation”; only Cary Grant and James Stewart are apt comparisons.</p>

<p>For Nighy, the character presented an irresistible challenge: how little can you get away with? Every movement is muted. He speaks in a desiccated whisper.</p>

<p>“I kept waiting for the soundman to come over and say: ‘Bill, I can’t hear a word.’” The Japanese and British share “a very elaborate code of conduct, performing their manners. And a kind of taboo on any public expression of deep emotion – or any emotion at all. I love doing that because I find it very moving. I find it also quite funny that there’s virtually nothing you can say or do. It’s sort of bonkers, obviously.”</p>

<p>Nighy was born in 1949, four years before the film is set. His first memory was getting a Coronation mug at a fete. “That black-and-white footage of kids playing in shorts,” says Nighy. “I was one of those kids.”</p>

<p>Living, he thinks, might be one of those movies that “refer to other movies as much as to real life. When you hear people talking about the 60s, I was there but I don’t recognise anything they say. Because only selected comment persists into the modern world. The way it actually was is entirely different.</p>

<p>“Conspicuously, today, there are other ways of behaving which are the opposite of restraint. But maybe not everybody in 1953 was as restrained as Mr Williams.”</p>

<p>Living is as far up Nighy’s alley as you can get without hitting the next street. He’s an old pro at bureaucrats awakened by girls in cafes. There’s also rain, cigarettes, Westminster, fabulous tailoring (Nighy has always avoided Shakespeare on account of the trousers) and lots about the transformative power of a trilby.</p>

<p>It’s the period in time to which he’s most drawn. Everyone hankers after an age about 60 or 70 years before, he once read. “Sixteenth century monks would complain that the modern world was going to pieces and that 70 years ago it was all fine. It’s how politicians can manipulate people by saying it used to be great. No, it didn’t. It was actually much worse. But there’s a sort of reflective nostalgia.”</p>

<p>Sometimes, that’s harnessed for the bad. At the moment, he thinks, “there’s a wave of reactionary thought, people trying to drag us backwards in time purely for self-advancement. It’s the easiest way to manipulate people: invent a past for which you can have bogus nostalgia and a future which is frightening and scary, largely because there are people of different ethnic origins. They’ve been doing it since I was a kid. The difference is, it’s digitised now.”</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the Blitz: Nighy knows it was horrendous but still hankers after it. “I think it’s to do with romance and sex. It unified people. They put aside any enthusiasm for division because they had bigger fish to fry.”</p>

<p>In fact, that fellow-feeling faded fast – though still a bit slower than it did after the early days of Covid. “How many times did you hear people say: ‘I hope we can hang on to some of this? Isn’t it great to hear the birdsong? To be in a clean environment? I hope people won’t just withdraw from one another again.’ And of course we’ve just pretty much gone back to normal.”</p>

<p>Nighy was raised in Caterham, halfway between Croydon and Crawley, by his mother, Catherine, a psychiatric nurse, and father, Alfred, a garage owner with natty sports jackets. The war was their big topic of conversation. “You were supposed to slip back into your life having seen dreadful, terrible things and been through an enormous amount of trauma.”</p>

<p>Alfred died of a heart attack when Bill was 25. The two men looked sufficiently similar that Catherine (who died in 2003) would go very quiet watching her son on screen. Some of Nighy’s stylings – social as well as sartorial – are emulation. “I did think about my dad making Living, because he was not unlike Mr Williams. He was a very nice person.”</p>

<p>Williams becomes galvanised by a modest project to construct a children’s playground on a bomb site: an 11th-hour attempt to be one of the kids getting stuck in on the swings, he says, not waiting for their mother on the sidelines.</p>

<p>Nighy was a fan of slides as a child, he says, “quite happy running and playing football. When I reached puberty it got complicated. I made a meal of it. I took it rather hard.” He overheard his mother saying he was shy. “Shy is a word I have difficulty with because I think there’s an enormous amount of vanity involved somewhere. But I aimed to please. I wanted to come top. I was an altar boy. I served mass five times a week.”</p>

<p>Nighy was all set for the seminary, but the call from God failed to materialise, not for lack of listening. Doubts began. “Certain people were gonna apparently burn in everlasting hellfire. People I knew. So you thought: ‘Maybe I should sort of say something?’ I remember asking questions and not getting any answers. And then I started worrying about my hair.”</p>

<p>At 15, he and a friend ran away to the Persian Gulf (“it looked good on the map”) and got as far as Marseilles. “We were very hungry and a bit scared because there were some very strange people on the docks.”</p>

<p>Back in Caterham, he was kicked out of grammar school and taken by his mother to the National Youth Employment Agency. “The bloke there had a big book of jobs and asked me what kind of thing I was interested in. I said: ‘Well, I wanna be an author.’ And my mother put her foot on mine under the desk and pressed down very, very hard, as if to say: ‘Don’t be so bloody stupid.’ And the bloke said: ‘Well, we don’t have any jobs for authors.’ And I said: ‘Well, I didn’t think you would. I just thought you’d best know.’”</p>

<p>Anyway, he did wangle Nighy work as a messenger boy on the Field magazine, going round posh London hotels changing their editions. “Sometimes they gave me the cab fare. It was all a bit, y’know, marvellous.”</p>

<p>He was less keen on the commute up to Victoria. “I remember thinking: if this is supposed to be my life, you have got to be kidding. This can’t happen. Too many people not saying anything crammed together. Awkward, embarrassing and uncomfortable.”</p>

<p>So, at 17, adventure No 2: to Paris, alone, “to write the great English short story. And I didn’t write a word.” He begged from tourists, was offered sex work but declined citing lack of experience.</p>

<p>Eventually he found his way to the Guildford School of Dance and Drama (“prance and murmur”), from there to rep in Liverpool, and touring the north with the likes of Jonathan Pryce and Julie Walters.</p>

<p>A decade of solid stage and radio work sustained him, just. In 1991, Sunday night serial The Men’s Room – shagging academics – upped his currency. He was in Arcadia and Skylight and Blue/Orange on stage; Lawless Heart, Still Crazy, Underworld, Shaun of the Dead at the cinema.</p>

<p>Love, Actually in 2003 saw another status upgrade. Skylight went to Broadway; so did another David Hare play, The Vertical Hour. On TV: award-winning turns in State of Play, The Lost Prince, Gideon’s Daughter and Page Eight.</p>

<p>Film credits became more prolific and prominent. Lots of big British hits: Pride, About Time, the Dad’s Army remake. Sometimes a bit of a blockbuster: Pirates, Harry Potter. Quiet dramas galore (Hope Gap, The Bookshop, Sometimes Always Never) but nothing with the kind of Oscars cut-through Living could manage.</p>

<p>Maybe Nighy’s shtick – hard to shift, because it’s genuine – can be a yoke? “I think his brand causes people to lose sight of his skill as an actor,” says Hermanus. He hopes Living “showcases his flexibility, the rigour of his process, and his capacity to deliver a heart-wrenching monologue as well as a twinkly one-liner”.</p>

<p>Every Sunday before the shoot, the director would head to Nighy’s place at 11am “and we would sit in his lounge and pore over the script. Bill would make us some tea. This is when we really bonded – talked about lives, our families and all the performances and films we love, and I would get to listen to the amazing array of music that he listens to – anything from bluegrass to hip-hop. I will remember my Sundays with Bill always.”</p>

<p>Nighy is not a method actor. Another reason lay-people love him is his habit of exploding his own profession. In one Bafta video, he recalls telling a drama student that, on stage, “I can absolutely guarantee you that I’m not feeling anything. I’m at work. I’m a bit busy. I’m a bit pushed. I have to achieve a total of about 15,000 things over about two-and-a-half hours. I can’t be feeling stuff. That I do in my own time.”</p>

<p>He’s catty about colleagues who fail to memorise their lines before rehearsals for fear it might stifle their creativity. Being off-book is a point of principle. “Wandering about saying the lines over and over and over and over so that you can eventually give an impression of spontaneity. That’s the job.”</p>

<p>Nighy talks about prep in the parlance of a footballer or a guitarist – both professions he much admires. Hours of keepy-uppy, endless perfecting the lick.</p>

<p>Ask co-stars about him and the jazz musician allusions flow freely. Burke says Nighy once “humbly suggested his entire oeuvre was based on ‘the double take’. He advocated double taking at: anyone entering in, any new information received, and he may have even pioneered double taking at one’s own private revelations, so a series of thoughts could fission out; exploding into the next one or interrupting the last; bringing something almost Chet Baker-like to actions as simple as entering, sitting down, and shifting to find a comfortable position. His liveness within such technical wizardry is what makes it so special.”</p>

<p>Burke, Wood, Sharp: they all rave about Nighy’s depth and discipline, openness and inclusivity, “gorgeous cheekiness, aliveness and playfulness” (Wood). The sense of letting you in on some magical private joke.</p>

<p>Sharp sends over more than 1,000 words of detailed praise. Sometimes he’d find a book in his trailer with a note saying: “Pertains to what we were talking about at dinner, a good read. Stay loose, baby – Bill”</p>

<p>“To say Bill is a good man is a fantastic understatement,” he writes. “He has helped me in my personal life in big ways.”</p>

<p>At another supper, Nighy told him about “a legendary actor, his senior, who he admired and loved” – and who is, I suspect, Michael Gambon. “He spoke of this man’s kindness and humanity, and how doing the simplest things, like fixing Bill’s tie when it was wonky, showed such kindness and respect for Bill, his junior, that it would fill Bill’s eyes with tears.</p>

<p>“This older actor’s work was of huge inspiration to him, but more than that, the essence of the man’s perspective, capacity for love, and natural inclination to create an equal playing ground with a younger actor, moved Bill beyond what he could articulate. He said he could never fully express this to him, but hoped he knew. Taking another bite of my food, I nodded, thinking: ‘I hope Bill knows that is exactly how I feel about him.’”</p>

<p>In Living, Williams is revived by the young. Nighy too? Not exactly, he says, then revises. “Thinking about it, I do find it refreshing to work with people of other generations. Older people can be kind of slightly besieged by life, or by the fact of their age.</p>

<p>“And I am unspeakably fortunate, beyond lucky. I don’t have anything I need to be younger for.”</p>

<p>In fact, he shudders, he’d hate it. Social media is “exactly what I don’t want. I don’t want to enumerate my friends. I’m working on less contact, not more.”</p>

<p>He tells me with horror that young people today must act as their own publicist. “Edit and curate and broadcast their own experience. That’s really tough. And if you are inexperienced and it gets combative … no wonder people become unhappy.”</p>

<p>Nighy’s people almost got him on Instagram, with the promise they’d do all the work. “But I pulled out. I just thought: I can’t. One of the things that I would’ve been required to do was to tell people that I’m in a film. I’m never gonna tell people I’m in a film. It’s just never gonna happen.”</p>

<p>At the London premiere of Living, he was asked by red carpet journalists what his favourite scene was. “And I couldn’t remember any of them. Normally, just to be sociable, I’d choose one. But I just didn’t have that kind of energy.</p>

<p>“There are certain PR questions to which there are only PR answers. It’s not lying, but it’s a very edited truth. And if you are in any way a moral creature, that’s probably why it’s sort of enervating. It’s a very particular kind of tiredness not because you’ve been doing anything dishonest, but it’s just not quite normal contact with other human beings.”</p>

<p>He hurriedly adds some qualifiers: it’s a champagne problem. And this isn’t abnormal. “This is nice and I’m not just smooth-talking.”</p>

<p>So I ask him what he would do if a doctor gave him six months. “I have no idea, honestly, Catherine. I’d want to spend time with my family. I might go somewhere distant and beautiful for a bit. But that would be worrying in case you started to, y’know, need some healthcare.”</p>

<p>Might he like to die by the sea, like Williams? He thinks he might. He goes to Aldeburgh quite a lot anyway. “It makes me philosophical, which is what you require sometimes.” The Shetlands could be good, he thinks. He talks briefly about how high a cliff he’d need. “I’d probably want to do it myself, rather than dwindle away in pain.”</p>

<p>Nighy once said he thought about death 12 times a day. He snorts, remembering the amazement. “That was quite a modest assessment. It’s probably more like 35.” Not all doomy, though: mostly whether or not shoes will outlive him.</p>

<p>He drains his water and the ice clinks. Noon with Nighy can feel like 3am with someone else. “And I don’t really believe it,” he says. That he’s going to die? “Yeah. I know it’s gonna happen, but I think maybe at the last minute somebody might make an exception.”</p>

<p>He leans back. “But then again, I sometimes think: I don’t think I can do a lot more of this. I’ve had quite a lot on.” He snorts again and I leave him, prepped for death, having the time of his life.</p>

<h2 id="1392702406402820976">How much money makes you happy? We ask an expert</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Money can buy happiness – just ask anyone without it. But the question of how much happiness has long been a focus of wellbeing science. I asked Prof Jan-Emmanuel De Neve, director at the University of Oxford Wellbeing Research Centre, what the data says.</p>

<p>Given we’re in a cost of living crisis, does this question even matter? Survival first, happiness later, right?</p>

<p>How we feel about the quality of our lives is what matters. So is there a link between money and happiness? Absolutely – especially at the bottom of the pay scale. As you move up, there are diminishing returns. So the wellbeing boost from a £20,000 salary moving to £40,000 would be significant, but to achieve that again, you’d have to move from £40,000 to £80,000, then £80,000 to £160,000. To get the same impact, you have to double each time.</p>

<p>Isn’t the magic number for happiness a £50,000 salary?</p>

<p>That’s from a 2010 study by two Nobel prize winners, Angus Deaton and Daniel Kahneman. They found that after $75,000 on average in the US – roughly £50,000 then – there was a flattening of emotions. So somebody making $100,000, when compared with someone making $75,000, wasn’t experiencing either more positive emotions or fewer negative emotions, such as worry. But since that study there’s been inflation and a deepening of the question itself.</p>

<p>How so?</p>

<p>It’s about what kind of happiness. If it’s the experience of positive emotions – so how happy you are right now, and absence of negative emotions – I’d estimate the satiation point now lies about £100,000 to £120,000. And if you’re looking for overall satisfaction with life, that point is higher still. There’s debate on the numbers though.</p>

<p>It’s shocking to think that only 1% of Britons will earn enough to feel life satisfaction. What else is debated?</p>

<p>Everyone agrees on the flattening of the curve. What people don’t agree on is the point at which happiness no longer goes up. There are few datasets capturing very rich people. The ones I’ve seen suggest a full flattening of the curve, and even point downwards.</p>

<p>The few ultra-wealthy people I’ve met have been surprisingly pessimistic – and stingy. I’ve also read studies that found the more money you have, the less empathic you are, which doesn’t bode well for happy relationships.</p>

<p>I think the most important question is not whether money makes you happy, but do happier individuals make more money? We showed that if you look at adolescents and their levels of happiness, it’s predictive of how much they earn later.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I like this – please don’t tell me some people are born to earn more.</p>

<p>Not at all! It means we must do everything we can for young people to have a good and positive mindset.</p>

<p>So perhaps we should stop thinking about GDP and think about national happiness.</p>

<p>Totally. As one of the editors of the World Happiness report, I can tell you that the relationship between GDP and population wellbeing starts breaking down after a certain level of GDP per capita. That flattening of the curve happens nationally, too. Growth for the sake of growth doesn’t translate into further wellbeing.</p>

<p>Somebody should have told Liz Truss!</p>

<p>But with sustainable growth – improving educational opportunities, reducing inequalities, etc – you can still raise average wellbeing.</p>


<h2 id="1342336099983627910">Twitter takeover: fears raised over disinformation and hate speech</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Elon Musk’s Twitter acquisition has been polarizing, sparking reactions from politicians, regulators and non-profits across different continents.</p>

<p>Some have expressed concerns about potential changes to Twitter’s content moderation policies now that it’s in the hands of the Tesla billionaire, while others celebrated how they expect the platform’s newly minted leader will handle content and speech on Twitter.</p>

<p>Senior politicians in the UK and Europe on Friday warned Musk over content moderation on Twitter, with the EU stressing the platform will “fly by our rules” and a UK minister expressing concerns over hate speech under the billionaire’s ownership.</p>

<p>The EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, wrote on the platform on Friday that “in Europe, the bird will fly by our rules”, in response to Musk’s earlier tweet saying “the bird is freed” in apparent confirmation that he had bought the business.</p>

<p>The EU is introducing the Digital Services Act, which includes provisions for removal of illegal content including hate speech.</p>

<p>The UK government flagged its own concerns on Friday, as the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said it would be “concerning” if a relaxation of content moderation led to a proliferation on hate speech on the platform.</p>

<p>“I think that would be concerning and it’s important that people have these platforms [and] use them responsibly rather than to promulgate hate speech,” she told Sky News.</p>

<p>Coffey added that the online safety bill, a landmark piece of legislation in the country tackling online hate speech, will return to parliament next week. However, it is understood that the bill will remain on pause after the government delayed its passage again this week.</p>

<p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, tweeted on Friday: “Any decision about allowing suspended users to return must be taken incredibly carefully & in direct consultation with experts in countering digital hate & misinformation.”</p>

<p>One internet safety campaigner said on Friday that the deal could “unravel” Twitter’s work on improving the platform, after reports that Musk has already fired the company’s head of legal policy, trust and safety, Vijaya Gadde.</p>

<p>Seyi Akiwowo, head of Glitch, a UK-based charity that campaigns against online abuse, said Gadde’s removal was a backwards step.</p>

<p>She tweeted: “I am very concerned that the progress Twitter has finally made on safety over the last 6 years will unravel in the next few weeks.”</p>

<p>In the US, civil rights organizations warned of harmful content on the platform, while Republicans celebrated the change in ownership.</p>

<p>The firing of Gadde sparked concern among civil liberties groups that fought for Trump’s Twitter ban, such as Muslim Advocates.</p>

<p>“Elon Musk claims that he doesn’t want Twitter to become a ‘free-for-all hellscape’ but he would guarantee that outcome by letting white nationalist hatemongers back on the platform and pushing out the staff responsible for policing hate content,” said Muslim Advocates’ senior policy counsel, Sumayyah Waheed. “This is not about left v right political brinkmanship or collegiate debates over free speech. This is about the safety of communities of color, people of minority faiths and other marginalized communities who are already under assault.”</p>

<p>The first amendment campaign group Pen America said that the platform must not allow disinformation – the deliberate distribution of false information – to flourish ahead of the midterm elections on 8 November.</p>

<p>Suzanne Nossel, the organization’s chief executive, said she would look for signs that Musk is willing to “learn the intricacies of a platform used worldwide with sometimes life or death consequences”.</p>

<p>She added: “With the election two weeks out, a pivotal indicator will be whether purveyors of disinformation are given free rein to mislead people over Twitter about when, where and how to vote.”</p>

<p>Angelo Carusone, the president of US media watchdog group Media Matters, feared the ownership change will “radically transform the current information landscape”, adding he, too, was deeply concerned the change was happening just days before the midterm elections.</p>

<p>“It is only a matter of time before Musk rolls back Twitter’s community standards, fires employees responsible for protecting users’ safety, and re-platforms Donald Trump and other accounts suspended for violence and abuse, and opens the floodgates of disinformation,” Carusone said in a statement. “Simply put: Twitter is now on a glide path to becoming a supercharged engine of radicalization. Under Musk’s leadership, Twitter will become a fever swamp of dangerous conspiracy theories, partisan chicanery, and operationalized harassment.”</p>

<p>Whether the former US president will be allowed back to the platform after he was permanently banned from Twitter in the days after the 6 January insurrection animated many of the online conversations in the US on Friday. Earlier this year, Musk said he would reverse that ban.</p>

<p>Non-profit watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked if Musk was prepared to respond if Trump directed his supporters to attack the government on Twitter.</p>

<p>“If you don’t have a great immediate answer, then it’s best to keep him off,” the organization tweeted.</p>

<p>On, Thursday Musk had attempted to play down concerns over harmful content. In a message to Twitter’s advertising clients, he tweeted that the platform “obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape” and the platform must be “warm and welcoming to all”.</p>

<p>But Musk’s very first public statement on Friday morning was to promise pseudonymous Maga influencer “Catturd” that he would be “digging in” to why the user’s account is “shadowbanned” – not showing up in search results. With 850,000 followers, the account is one of the more prominent on the US right.</p>

<p>Sanjay Bhandari, the chair of football’s anti-racism organization, Kick It Out, said Musk must not let “super trolls” like Trump back on to the platform before introducing technical fixes that shield users from harmful content.</p>

<p>Bhandari said Musk’s statement that users can “choose your experience according to your desired preferences” must be followed up by action.</p>

<p>“Before Musk enables the super trolls, he must implement the technological changes that enable us to have the experience that we want on the platform and not have abuse forced on us,” he added.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some Republican politicians celebrated Musk’s Twitter acquisition. Trump himself said on Truth Social that he was very “happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by the Radical Left”.</p>

<p>Congress members Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Lauren Boebert lauded the move as a boon to freedom of speech. “Free speech. Liberal tears,” Jordan tweeted.</p>

<h2 id="104139488736988069">‘Whoever says Syria’s safe is a liar’: country’s tourist drive at odds with human rights record</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>Affordable, friendly and ready for tourists – this is the message behind a new drive to promote Syria as a holiday destination, despite a recent human rights report determining the Assad government was responsible for “crimes against humanity” and the Foreign Office warning against all travel to the country.</p>

<p>In a bid to revive the country’s once thriving tourism industry before the devastating civil war killed thousands, levelled cities and drove 13 million people from their homes, the government has begun a concerted campaign to convince investors – and holidaymakers – that Syria has much to offer foreign visitors.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Ministry of Tourism launched 25 tourism projects at an investment conference in Damascus, including the prospect of creating private beaches after the announcement of a $60m (£52m) Russian-backed deal to build a hotel complex in the coastal town of Latakia.</p>

<p>Whether tourists will want to holiday in a country where thousands of civilians have been killed in the past decade and the risk of regional violence is high remains to be seen. But a number of high-profile travel influencers have spent the last year doing just that, and promoting their experience of visiting “the Syria the media won’t show you” to millions of viewers online, boosting the country’s image as a viable destination for anyone wishing for a different travel experience.</p>

<p>After the easing of pandemic restrictions in March, a number of travel bloggers began posting videos of their trip to Syria – and now some are even organising tours.</p>

<p>Xavier Raychell Blancharde offers guided tours of Syria through a travel company named after his YouTube channel, Travelling the Unknown, after first visiting Syria in 2018. The tours start at $1,300 (£1,230), which he told the Guardian would show a “different side” of Syria and counter the isolation of the country, especially for civilians living there.</p>

<p>The Spanish travel blogger Joan Torres, who also organises Syria expeditions for €1,590 (£1,380), said he was able to travel by himself the first time he visited in 2018, though the government later required that tourists travel with a guide. Torres prompted anger from Syrians abroad with his first trip, especially with his description of Aleppo as having been “liberated” by Assad’s forces.</p>

<p>Torres says he might not use the same language today but admits that he does not speak openly about Syria when it comes to the war. However, he says he similarly controls his comments when he goes to Saudi Arabia and other countries.</p>

<p>“I will not say anything bad about the government, of course, because I’m risking detention,” he says. “In which country where you go often, where there’s no freedom of speech, would you start saying bad things about the government?”</p>

<p>Torres is not alone. Leading YouTubers such as Drew Binsky, Eva zu Beck and Thomas Brag have gained millions of views documenting their visits to Syria.</p>

<p>“The vloggers are going to Syria because you need to do something different to stand out,” says Sophie Fullerton, a disinformation researcher. “There’s a pattern of the travel influencers going to get more attention – there was one who went from about 700 followers up to 50,000 after he went to Syria.”</p>

<p>Fullerton says the arrival of tourists is used by government-friendly media, to promote a normalised image of Syria. State news agency Sana has reports on even small tour groups visiting historical sites.</p>

<p>Syrian activists say the influencers, knowingly or not, have delivered an inaccurate image of the country to their millions of subscribers of the regime and life for the 4.5 million people besieged in the rebel-held north-west.</p>

<p>Fared al-Mahlool, an Idlib-based journalist and researcher who was displaced from his home, says he is angered by the disparity between what is shown in influencer content and his reality. “Syria will not be safe as long as Assad controls power. There are thousands of detainees in Assad’s prisons, poverty and unemployment. Whoever says that Syria is safe is a liar,” says Mahlool.</p>

<p>Mahlool believes that after a decade of war, the government is trying to normalise its image by encouraging influencers as well as entertainers to visit, pointing towards a statement by the Egyptian singer Hany Shaker saying he was invited by the tourism ministry.</p>

<p>Yet despite tour providers having to work closely with the government when organising visits – according to travel companies offering trips to Syria, tourists can only visit in groups, must apply for security clearance weeks in advance and must be accompanied by a guide – Blancharde says that the purpose of his work is to help alleviate the poverty facing millions of Syrian people.</p>

<p>Yet Fullerton says that the increase in travel to Syria raises questions about the ethics of making travel content. “People should be able to travel where they want but you need to engage in ethical travel and you need to be mindful of what has happened there,” she says. “The people who come and rewrite the last 10 years of history do a disservice to the Syrians who can’t go back.”</p>


<h2 id="799305635447130149">‘Detached from reality’: Trevor Noah’s view of racist Sunak ‘backlash’ divides opinion</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The row began with a single call to a UK radio station, was stoked by one of America’s best-known comedians and ended with former cabinet ministers wading in – and Downing Street, too.</p>

<p>At the heart of the furore: a claim that Rishi Sunak had experienced a racist “backlash” after becoming the UK’s first British-Asian prime minister.</p>

<p>For many, how something across the Atlantic created such a kickback in Westminster is an example of the dangers of drawing direct cultural and political parallels between two differing nations – and the power of Twitter.</p>

<p>“There has been no racist backlash against Sunak from anybody with any public standing in Britain,” Sunder Katwala, director of British Future, a thinktank focusing on identity and integration, immigration and opportunity, told the Guardian.</p>

<p>“This shows more solid anti-prejudice norms in our media and politics than in the US.”</p>

<p>He was reacting to a segment by Trevor Noah on the US satirical news show, the Daily Show, in which he alleged that Britons were concerned that “Indians are going to take over Great Britain”.</p>

<p>His polemic was inspired by a telephone caller on LBC radio who said Sunak was “not even British” and “doesn’t love England like Boris does”.</p>

<p>The caller, who claimed to be a Tory party member, added: “Could you imagine me becoming the prime minister of Pakistan or Saudi Arabia? No. These things matter. We’re talking about England – 85% of English people are white.”</p>

<p>“Watching the story of Rishi Sunak becoming England’s first prime minister of colour, of Indian descent, of all these things and then seeing the backlash, is one of the more telling things about how people view the role that they or their people have played in history,” Noah said in his response.</p>

<p>“You hear a lot of the people saying ‘Oh, they’re taking over, now the Indians are going to take over Great Britain and what’s next?’ And I always find myself going: ‘So what? What are you afraid of?’”</p>

<p>The comedian compared the caller to Tucker Carlson, the rightwing Fox News presenter, which led to accusations that he was “projecting” American views on race on to Britain.</p>

<p>Former cabinet minister Sajid Javid, who was Britain’s first non-white chancellor and home secretary, said Noah was “simply wrong” and called his monologue “a narrative catered to his audience, at a cost of being completely detached from reality”.</p>

<p>Britain, Javid insisted, was “the most successful multiracial democracy on Earth and proud of this historic achievement”.</p>

<p>Asked whether Sunak believes Britain is a racist country, a Downing Street spokesperson said: “No he doesn’t.”</p>

<p>It is hard to deny the LBC caller’s racism, Katwala explained, but the strength of feeling boils down to a simple belief – that while there is a “toxic rejectionist fringe with an excessive share of online voice” who might be more inclined to contact radio shows, their bigotry should not be held as representative of what Britons think.</p>

<p>“It’s important to understand the differences between the US and the UK,” he said.</p>

<p>“It’s an important problem for America, that in the Trump era people like Steve Bannon managed to dissolve the boundary between extreme politics and the Republican mainstream.</p>

<p>“You have Republican candidates having to be ambivalent about racism or prejudice, violent protests, false conspiracy claims.”</p>

<p>In the UK, he said, even the likes of Nigel Farage are still “aware of where that boundary is”.</p>

<p>Tom Holland, historian and author, added that the “inability of American liberals to understand the world beyond the US in anything but American terms is a thing of wonder. The likelihood of the rightwing party in the US choosing a Hindu as its leader is, I would agree, effectively zero.”</p>

<p>Plenty of people agreed with Noah, however. Dr Shola Mos-Shogbamimu, a British-Nigerian activist and author, said the presenter was “spot on”.</p>

<p>“There was and is backlash at Rishi Sunak’s appointment as Britain’s first Asian prime minister,” she wrote. “Don’t mind the liars denying it with their gaslighting. It’s what some Brits do best. They are so bold with their Caucacity. Keep speaking truth.”</p>

<p>Though Sunak’s appointment as PM was a historic moment for the UK, it drew a dividing line between those who celebrated the ascent of a Hindu politician and those who emphasised his policies would only deliver “more violence” for ethnic minorities. And though racism in the UK might not always be overt, critics said, there are plenty of examples of a more insidious form of oppression.</p>

<p>“It’s not as if representation doesn’t matter at all, but only measuring success on these terms is incredibly narrow,” Maya Goodfellow, author of Hostile Environment: How Immigrants Became Scapegoats, told the Guardian.</p>

<p>“It ignores racial disparities in Covid deaths, higher rates of poverty among certain racial groups or the Windrush scandal, which was just four years ago.</p>

<p>“The fixation on trickle-down equality obscures a thoroughgoing discussion about the way racism and, crucially, racial inequalities, change shape but continue to run deep in Britain.”</p>


<h2 id="148633836491065747">Northern Ireland secretary plays for time by failing to name election date</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The Northern Ireland secretary has announced he will call an election for the Stormont assembly but refused to name a date.</p>

<p>Chris Heaton-Harris said on Friday he would do his “legal duty” to call an election within 12 weeks and promised to give more detail next week after talks with Northern Ireland party leaders.</p>

<p>The statement, made at a hastily organised press conference in Belfast, caused confusion and left open the possibility the UK government would try to delay the poll.</p>

<p>A deadline to restore devolved government expired at midnight on Thursday, which by law means there must be an election for a new assembly within 12 weeks. Heaton-Harris had vowed to swiftly announce one if the deadline expired, creating expectations of a mid-December poll.</p>

<p>However, in a rare consensus, Northern Ireland politicians and analysts had said an election would be futile and do nothing to break a political deadlock that has paralysed Stormont.</p>

<p>In a brief address to the media, Heaton-Harris sought to buy more time. “I hear when parties say that they really do not want an election at all but nearly all of them are parties that signed up to the rules, to the law, that means I need to call an election,” he said. “So you’ll hear more from me on that particular point next week.”</p>

<p>The Northern Ireland Office said the statement, given to TV cameras on a pavement in view of the public at 4pm, was to be embargoed until 5pm, a request that was widely mocked and created a sense of disarray in the Northern Ireland Office.</p>

<p>Heaton-Harris denied making a U-turn. “I am still going to be calling an election,” he said.</p>

<p>He linked the pause in naming a date to negotiations between the UK and EU over the Northern Ireland protocol. “The atmosphere in those talks is completely changed in recent weeks and I am optimistic and I really do believe that we can get somewhere on those too,” Heaton-Harris said.</p>

<p>Northern Ireland’s chief electoral officer, Virginia McVea, said she would continue making a contingency plan for a 15 December election and apologised to election workers for the uncertainty.</p>

<p>The Democratic Unionist party created the deadlock after an assembly election in May by boycotting power sharing in protest against the post-Brexit Irish Sea border. This prevented the formation of an executive, leading to seven months of political stasis.</p>

<p>The party’s leader, Jeffrey Donaldson, rebuffed appeals from Downing Street, business leaders and other parties to revive power sharing, saying he had a mandate from DUP voters to stay out of Stormont until unionist concerns over the Northern Ireland protocol were addressed.</p>

<p>After Heaton-Harris’s statement on Friday, Donaldson accused the secretary of state of dithering. “The chaos continues,” he said.</p>

<p>Michelle O’Neill, Sinn Féin’s vice-president, said it was a “bizarre U-turn”. “People here are left in limbo and uncertain what is to come next,” she said.</p>

<p>Heaton-Harris had raised the spectre of an election to pressure the DUP but the party dug in, saying it did not fear a poll, and vowed to continue its boycott after an election if the protocol remained unchanged.</p>

<p>The former taoiseach Bertie Ahern swelled a clamour saying an election would be futile. “It doesn’t matter whether people vote black, white, yellow or pink in the election, it won’t change anything. The protocol is still the protocol and it isn’t up for discussion in the election,” he told RTÉ.</p>

<p>Jon Tonge, a politics professor at the University of Liverpool and an authority on Northern Ireland elections, said Heaton-Harris was wavering: “He’s now playing for time hoping something will turn up.” Tonge urged the government to pass emergency legislation to postpone the vote and overhaul power-sharing rules so that no party could veto an executive.</p>

<p>The assembly has not functioned for four of the past six years, leaving civil servants to run government departments and public services. Business leaders said the political limbo was deterring investment and costing jobs.</p>


<h2 id="1958059697775019584">The Devil’s Hour review – proof that Peter Capaldi is the world’s most terrifying actor</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>I do not damn with faint praise when I say that the back of Peter Capaldi’s head is the most frightening thing in the opening episode of The Devil’s Hour, Amazon Prime Video’s new spooky six-part drama by Tom Moran. I mean only to place on record the underacknowledged truth that Capaldi is the most frightening actor working today. The only reason a generation of children were not permanently traumatised by his years as Doctor Who is because they do not yet know enough of life. If you do, you see that all of it lives in Capaldi’s face and that most of it is suffering, grief and pain.</p>

<p>We see little of that haunted visage at first, though it is clear his character is the pivot around which the whole thing will swing. Our main concern is with Lucy (Jessica Raine), an overstretched social worker also dealing with an aged mother who has dementia, the end of her marriage to Mike (Phil Dunster) and an unreachable, heartbreaking puzzle of a child, Isaac (Benjamin Chivers). He is emotionless, suggestible, vulnerable and given to seeing and hearing from figures invisible to others. Lucy wakes up every night at 3.33am exactly, wrenched from awful visions as she sleeps. Are they ordinary nightmares caused by current stresses and strains, or the results of buried trauma – as other momentary hallucinations and apparent flashbacks suggest? Or are they, as Capaldi’s face implies, something worse?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, DI Ravi Dhillon (Nikesh Patel) – a suave young man except when he is vomiting over bloody crime scenes – is investigating a bloody murder. The perpetrator is linked to the disappearance of a young boy years ago and, by the end of the first episode, to Lucy too.</p>

<p>Just about every horror trope you could ask for is here, piling up like poisoned candy in a child’s Halloween bucket. There is the Omen-meets-Sixth Sense character of Isaac. There are flickering figures half-glimpsed and gone. Images of bloodstained soft toys and nightgown hems and a shotgun under a chin. There are shadows everywhere.</p>

<p>And then there’s Capaldi, handcuffed to a table in a darkened interview room, talking gnomically to Lucy about everything that has unfolded for them, to which we are not yet entirely privy. “What’s the worst thing you’ve ever experienced?” he asks her – an unsettling enough question anyway, that he is asking with That Face, which should cause all the skin to fly off her body. “All of this!” replies Lucy “You!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Lucy,” he replies sorrowfully. “You’ve suffered far worse than me. You just don’t know it yet.” Dum dum DAAAAAH!</p>

<p>It’s great fun. Its many, many pieces – which if they gel will make it a great show in all sorts of other ways – are currently held together by Raine’s absolutely storming performance. She is fantastic as the mother consumed by love and worry, the courageous professional – there is a well-wrought domestic violence storyline that ratchets up the tension – and the possible victim who is afraid she might be losing her grip on sanity (although whether she’s a victim of a past, present or future evil we cannot be sure). The supernatural element is less important so far than the acute psychological horror her performance evokes. It’s brilliantly done. If the rest of the series matches up to her, we are in for a truly terrifying treat.</p>


<h2 id="1764184911487248447">The twisty, drama-filled Elon Musk-Twitter saga: a timeline</h2>

<h4></h4>

<p>The saga is over. Elon Musk has finally bought Twitter after months of to-and-fro marked by legal rows, U-turns and, inevitably, Twitter spats.</p>

<p>There will be more drama to come, by virtue of the platform’s centrality to news and politics as well as the unpredictable personality of its new owner. But the months leading up to the deal have been compelling corporate entertainment for bystanders. Here is a timeline of what happened.</p>

<p>4 April – Elon Musk becomes the biggest shareholder in Twitter as the billionaire reveals that he has accumulated a 9.2% stake, worth nearly $3bn at the time, prompting market speculation that a takeover bid could be in the offing. The Tesla CEO is a prolific user of the platform and had more than 80 million followers in early April (it is now more than 100 million).</p>

<p>5 April – Twitter announces it is appointing Musk to its board. Parag Agrawal, Twitter’s chief executive, says he is “excited” by the move, adding that Musk is both a “passionate believer and intense critic” of the platform. It’s the latter that will come to the fore in the following months.</p>

<p>11 April – In the first sign that the Elon Musk/Twitter alliance will not be an easy one, Agrawal reveals that Musk will not be joining the board after all, without giving a reason why. It’s the first big U-turn in a story that will contain a few of them.</p>

<p>14 April – Musk announces an offer to buy Twitter at $54.20 per share, valuing the company at more than $40bn, saying he wants to release its “extraordinary potential” to boost free speech and democracy across the world.</p>

<p>15 April – In an indication of deep mutual distrust that never entirely goes away, Twitter adopts a “poison pill” defence against Musk’s bid, designed to stop an unwanted suitor from accumulating a significant stake.</p>

<p>25 April – After whirlwind talks, and minimal due diligence (which will later turn out to become a significant problem for Musk) a deal is reached for the entrepreneur to buy Twitter for $54.20 per share, or $44bn. In a statement posted to Twitter, Musk says: “Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated.”</p>

<p>5 May – Musk goes through his contact list and secures more than $7bn in external funding for the deal. Contributors include: Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Oracle founder Larry Ellison; Binance, the cryptocurrency exchange; and Qatar Holding, part of the gulf state’s investment fund.</p>

<p>10 May – Musk says he will reverse Twitter’s ban on Donald Trump, who was removed from the platform in January 2021 in the wake of the Capitol riots. “I think it was a morally bad decision and foolish in the extreme,” says Musk, referring to the ban.</p>

<p>13 May – Musk starts to get cold feet about the deal and announces that it is “temporarily on hold” while he awaits details supporting Twitter’s assertion that fewer than 5% of its users were spam or fake accounts. Musk says he remains committed to the acquisition.</p>

<p>16 May – In an incident that is symbolic of Musk’s behaviour during the deal, the Tesla boss replies to a thread on spam accounts by Twitter’s CEO, Parag Agrawal, with a poo emoji. (Unsurprisingly, the emoji will turn up in Twitter’s filings against Musk a few months later.)</p>

<p>17 May – The Tesla CEO’s stance hardens, as he states that the deal “cannot move forward” until his concerns about the counting of spam accounts are resolved.</p>

<p>6 June – Lawyers representing Musk accuse Twitter of committing a “material breach” of his agreement to buy the company by failing to hand over sufficient information about the number of spam users. Arguments like this, which pick over the merger agreement signed by Musk, will form the rationale of the billionaire’s formal attempt to quit the deal the following month.</p>

<p>16 June – Twitter’s prospective owner meets directly with employees at the company for the first time since agreeing the takeover, focusing on “freedom of speech” in an online address. Musk also warns that costs at the company exceed revenue, describing it as “not a great situation”. But he does not directly answer questions about a potential restructuring.</p>

<p>8 July – Musk announces he is terminating the deal, claiming that Twitter is “in material breach of multiple provisions” of the merger agreement. Twitter, backed by an agreement that does not appear to contain much wiggle room for walking away, says it will take legal action to make Musk buy the company.</p>

<p>12 July – Twitter lodges a lawsuit in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, demanding that Musk closes the deal on the agreed terms. Some of the language is punchy, describing Musk’s behaviour as a “model of bad faith”.</p>

<p>22 July – Twitter announces a drop in revenue in its quarterly results – down 1% to $1.2bn in the three months from April to 30 June. It blames the decline on uncertainty generated by the takeover saga and a weak advertising market.</p>

<p>29 July – Musk countersues Twitter, accusing the company of deliberately miscounting the number of spam accounts on its platform as part of a “scheme” to mislead investors. Twitter’s own lawsuit against Musk is dismissed as “gaudy rhetoric”, as both sides kept up the corporate cat-calling. Twitter describes the suit as a “a story, imagined in an effort to escape a merger agreement that Musk no longer found attractive”.</p>

<p>30 August – Musk adds accusations from a Twitter whistleblower, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, to his countersuit. Zatko, a former head of security at Twitter, has accused the company of serial failings in its information security set-up. However, legal experts say Zatko’s allegations are probably not enough to tip the legal balance in Musk’s favour. Twitter remains the favourite to win the day in Delaware.</p>

<p>7 September – Musk fails in an attempt to delay the Delaware trial as a judge rules that the case will go ahead from 17 October. “I am convinced that even four weeks’ delay would risk further harm to Twitter,” writes Kathaleen McCormick, of Delaware’s court of chancery.</p>

<p>29 September – A Delaware court, as part of the forthcoming trial process, releases text messages between Musk and his closest confidants as he moved to buy Twitter. The messages are revealing. For instance, the podcaster Joe Rogan asked Musk in April whether he would “liberate Twitter from the censorship happy mob”. Musk replied: “I will provide advice, which they may or may not choose to follow.”</p>

<p>4 October – In a surprise move, Musk offers to buy Twitter after all, on the terms agreed in April. One legal expert said the decision appeared to show that the Tesla CEO was “finally listening to his lawyers”. It was always the case that Musk was going to struggle to win in Delaware. The announcement comes two days before the billionaire was due to be interviewed under oath by Twitter’s lawyers as part of preparations for the trial.</p>

<p>5 October – The Delaware judge Kathaleen McCormick declines to postpone the trial, saying no one has asked for hold-up in proceedings yet.</p>

<p>6 October – Another exchange of mutual contempt between Musk and Twitter, this time via Judge McCormick’s office. Musk asks for a postponement of the trial, with his lawyers saying Twitter “will not take yes for an answer”. Twitter says Musk was effectively saying “Trust us … we mean it this time” and demands the trial goes ahead on 17 October. Judge McCormick sided with Musk, giving both sides until 5pm on 28 October to complete the deal.</p>

<p>13 October – A court filing from the social media company is made public that says Musk is under a federal investigation related to the Twitter takeover. The filing does not say what the focus of the investigation is, or which federal authorities are investigating.</p>

<p>20 October – The Washington Post reports that Musk told prospective investors that he plans to axe nearly 75% of Twitter’s 7,500 employees if he takes over the company.</p>

<p>26 October – Musk visits the Twitter headquarters in San Francisco, carrying a sink. The Tesla CEO reportedly tells Twitter employees he doesn’t plan to lay off as many as 75% of the company’s staff.</p>

<p>27 October – Sources familiar with the matter say Musk has completed the deal. Several of Twitter’s top executives, including the chief executive, Parag Agrawal, reportedly depart.</p>

<p>28 October – Twitter confirms the deal in a filing to the US financial regulator. The filing says the deal closed the previous day.</p>
