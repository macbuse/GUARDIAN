progress has stalled not because of specific barriers against women but because the wider issues have been unresolved. 
When it comes to equality the biggest barriers is lack of accountability and lack of truly being blind to someone's background when deciding positions of skill or otherwise.
Now, while it is true that by far men are the bigger proportion of transgressors even beyond the ratio in positions of power, it is not BECAUSE they are men that the problem arises.
So my small tech start-up I worked for illegally fired all of its women and ethnic minorities on the same day but it also did the same thing to several white men and the reason had nothing to do with gender or race but to do with power and greed. And no there was no accountability available.
Also where I had tried to help a vulnerable woman, I was equally block from progress by institutions run by women, Priti Patel, Cressida Dick and a head of local social services.
You mention accolades for progress naming women who have furthered their own cause but could not find one man's name to add to the list.
If you seek to redress balance by saying that an under represented group needs to suddenly fill the majority of senior positions at the same time you make it harder for people with skills in majority groups to break through very different ceilings.
The final point to make is that international women's day was set up as a communist ideal and not necessarily aligned with Western democratic ideals which is why it is a holiday in China but barely mentioned here.
The solution is to address needs, don't simply look at where there are imbalances and make sure that when people are reported such as #metoo or Boris Johnson's partygate that people are held to account rather depending on people choosing to resign.
And Labour is a long way from addressing many core issues and Theresa May and Margaret Thatcher are hardly beacons for what was done for women.

TBH looking at specific groups highlights a problem across Britain today. How much of these challenges that women face are down to the growing inequalities that we have seen in the last decade? Businesses beholden to investors looking for quick returns face pressure to minimise costs and maximise profits. The largest cost burden for most businesses is staff. So pay or jobs becomes the payoff for ensuring well-off investors are kept happy and well paid executives keep their jobs.
So this really ought to be part of a larger narrative. It may well be that the tax burden falls on the most well-paid but it is the least well-paid that shoulders the burden of profitability quite often. Women of all ethnicities are on the front line of this to be sure but these problems affect so many other members of society.
With the cost of living sky-rocketing as retailers appear to take advantage of the inflationary environment to push up prices, energy costs make even the relatively comfortable balk at the idea of putting the lights on and the cost of working in this country increases with Sunak's NIC hike these issues are becoming universal. For the last two years the question of who will foot the bill for his supposed largesse has been mulled over. Now we see the bill. 
So yes, there is a need to look at the progress made in women's equality. Just as there is across Britain today. The hollow rhetoric of 'levelling up' needs strident challenging.

I believe the U.K. took its foot off the regulatory pedal and too many legal technicalities prevent women succeeding in equality cases. This is i. Stark contract to - Scandinavia for instance - where equality is rigidly enforced and monitored. 
I am a lawyer facing my own case on an executive team of only men — all far less accomplished but keen to ensure the PE guys in Boston don’t find out who actually was doing the great work. Pushed out for a lesser qualified middle age man. Our tribunals and laws don’t help us. The harsh reality for women in the workplace is still not acknowledged. Too much emphasis placed on ‘having children’ when this is a symptom not the cause. Many women choose to forfeit family life due to the obstacles presented every day in the workplace and it exists at all levels of business. Indeed it gets worse the higher the ladder you go. 
This is due to power still residing with men. Women that say otherwise do not help women. Rules such as gender reporting do not include the majority of companies being smes - the right to equality should be universal and not depend on the size or value of company you work for. The U.K. does not respect women in business. This is observed in other countries also - such as the US. The U.K. is one of the worst in the developed world for equality for women - without any shadow of a doubt. The English boys club is alive and well.

Middle class women in Britain-and white middle class women in particular-are one of the most privileged groups in this country.For whilst they don't control the levers of power they have influence with the men who do.And they have choices that generally aren't open to their menfolk.For instance the most affluent family areas in this country contain a relatively high percentage of working-aged women who don't work.
Indeed the ongoing debate about whether mothers should work is only relevant to middle class mothers who have a high earning partner.Because for working class women and for lone mothers not working is likely to drive their families into poverty.And even when they do work they can still live in poverty for in-work poverty poverty disproportionately hits lone mothers and working class women.And working class black and asian women are hit hardest of all.
It may not be a popular thing to say here but i think middle class women and white middle class women need to check their privilege from time to time.For they have been the main beneficiaries of feminism and some might argue that rather wanting equality with their equally privileged menfolk what they really want is the best of both worlds as and when it suits them.

"doubling the number of businesses the government’s Start Up Loans scheme is delivering through a five-year funding guarantee that will fund 20,000 new businesses a year over the next five years."
There is an important distinction that should be made here.
The conservative method through the pandemic was to throw money at systems that didnt exist. Thus controls and support weren't in place, hence fraud was rife - from bounceback, furlough and procurement.
These systems would be embedded under a labour government as they are across Europe.
They would have the controls and support structures at all times and thus work efficiently and towards investment and productive gain.
The conservatives literally spaffed huge amounts up the wall - and hoped the volume ensured that it covered the issue with little look at the waste.
Labour would achieve more with less over any given period of time - even with spending plans that appear to spend more.
The conservatives increase debt - Labour actually reduce it.The conservatives spending plans are lower whilst everyone pays more.Under labour we actually spend less but everyone earns more and not just earns more - but gains a societieal interest in the production of society.

Many of the policy aspirations outlined here are worthy and laudable.
But a word of warning to Starmer's and Reeves' Labour. Do not be so seduced by the apparent 'successes' of Johnson (not least with so-called 'Red Wall' voters) that you fall into one of the most dangerous traps of Johnson's conduct in office.
Do not promise what you cannot deliver. The post-pandemic*, 21st-century Cold War era - heaven forbid that it turn into a Hot War, but I rate our chances of avoiding that as about 35-40% at best - are going to impose on any government of any colour here, in Europe and far beyond some fiendishly tough choices, choices that will force them to drop very many cherished political goals and ambitions.
A party that is honest about that and about what may realistically be implemented in very much straitened circumstances will get my vote (excepting the Tories, of course, who under Johnson especially have lied so much as to be irrevocably beyond the pale). 
*There will be legitimate disagreement, needless to say, about the extent to which we really are in a post-pandemic era. COVID19 is very much still with us, even if the horrors of the Ukraine war have kicked it into news-cycle touch.

Indeed they have that doesn’t mean they were any good. 
May and her protege Patel aren’t adverts for advocating equality, and the other one though hated as she was by many did save London from flooding.
She was a tower of strength for the climate brigade that woman and Beeching got rid of more coal burning and of course methane emitting milk in schools. Than any other government.
If it hadn’t been for Thatcher the Black Country would still be knee deep in soot.
Although no advocate for Tory women in power their have been many excellent woman in politics and labour have some good ones at the moment.
I suspect more electable than any of their top men including Stramer he a little to blue dog for me.
Detested the Iron Lady mind you I was lucky during her time and Blair’s Cool Britannia phase.
Certainly every last one of the women who have ever been in parliament including May were streets ahead of the current male members of the front bench and any one of them would be better than the suspect, except Patel.

Statues mean a lot or the Tories wouldn't be so worked up about statues of celebrated slave owners being taken down. Point is as the Tory use of statues as distraction shows you can do other things at the same time.Pushing for a statute does not mean that actions aren't being taken on the other things. Unlike the Conservative actions of the last decade that have increased poverty, increased child poverty 50% (since Labour were last in Gov), increased inequality and reduced incomes of women.Quite frankly, that Labour have any policies toward improving anything at all for women is already close to infinitely more than the Conservatives are doing or planning. Conservatives seem quite happy for everything to get worse for women. Take the chances of a successful rape conviction for example or their total inaction on online abuse of women (harassment of female MPs). Nothing gets done their because the Majority of Conservatives, being male, don't experience it.

Neither the socialist parties nor the other parties (and certainly not the far-left parties, which, despite their statements, are also if not more macho than the others) favor the advent of women in the decision-making spheres. Women must stop waiting for men's approval. Certainly, some of them are incompetent (how many in men??), certainly others believe useful to imitate men to make themselves heard (for what result? One always prefers the original to the copy). No, ladies, do not imitate anyone, be yourself, and show that another management is possible. But, just like men for that matter, avoid corruption and the scent of power because then you will prove that you are no better than your male colleagues who have been destroying the world for so many centuries.

No.1 is good, affordable, reliable childcare is 1000 per cent the most pressing issue, paternal leave at birth to cement co-parenting practices. It’s insane how much economic, cultural and social benefit the country is losing given women’s high levels of achievement and education. All well documented and quantified in Professor Linda Stott’s “The Double X Economy”. It’s undeniable. No.2 address the problem of unrestricted access to pornography; poor education in social responsibility of boys and young men ESP teaching recognition that superior physical strength is a privilege and a responsibility; zero tolerance and proper action on women’s justice issues - violence, rape, sexual abuse within police, criminal justice and legal systems.

Because many attitudes lie in the subconscious mind of humans, both male and female. Especially Business rewards ruthless behaviour. The message has long been not to be kind to each other but to beat each other. If you can't beat them, join them. A lot of successful business women had to take on somewhat male attributes to succeed and made life harder for many women at the lower end of the career ladder. Rather than teaching society that treating each other fairly will be a win win for all it was just about gaining the same rights. Instead of teaching men to be better people they taught them to be scared of saying the wrong thing. Because capitalism thrives on selfish behaviour. Humans are doomed. There I said it (Woman here...)

An argument is a connected series of statements, including at least one premise, intended to demonstrate that another statement, the conclusion, is true. 
Claim: Labour has not had a female leader.
Premise: A woman has temporarily led the Labour party 3 timesConclusion: It is wrong to say Labour has never had a female leader.
The trouble with that argument is the distinction between a Party Leader and someone who temporarily leads the party. 
What you say might be true but it is trivially true, and a point scoring exercise, considering everyone understood what the OP meant when he said Labour has never had a female leader.
So tell me how is it not an argument?

You have mentioned a key problem - Investors looking for fast return - macho quick buck culture- taking risks that women would be more vigilant about -100% - I have come up against it as the only women on an executive team. I am keen on compliance - this is my regulatory duty - but that is seen as an obstacle. Men take risks often to look good to investors - I do not heed to take risks - the excellence of my work delivers the results - proved results fat higher than any of them ever achieved .. but possibly in a more discrete way than banging my chest - as the male colleagues do. So women get walked all over pushed out - not valued - despite often being far better.

Progress for women has stalled because while women rose to the occasion, educated themselves, got careers, evolved, men didn't evolve alongside them or step up to join them.
The result is women didn't suddenly find themselves enjoying a much better position, but instead found themselves having to occupy two positions at once. Men, undoubtedly, will have faced their own existential crisis in response to this.
Alongside this, women have been undermined by two bedfellows: consumerism-driven social media applying pressure on how women look and behave; and male-led woke campaigns, the aim of which is to dissolve spaces where women can feel safe and valued.

With all these types of articles/discussions it is always the people in the middle who get forgotten. Women who have really good careers or women at the bottom. It is always the ones in the middle who get forgotten or punished. For instance the NI rise will really hit my daughter who hasn’t had a pay rise for two years and would love to have a baby which she’s sadly cannot afford. It is no wonder we have a falling birth rate. People like Rachel Reeves also never considers that some women would actually like to stay at home and look after their children but this isn’t an option unless you are on benefits or marry a really rich man.

I think your points are true in the context of the legal profession, which I have some contact with through relatives. But law is such a dinosaur environment. Even their use of technology, even standard office software, is 20 years behind everyone else. And it has a disproportionate share of entitled men who went to boys schools. In a lot of other sectors, my own included, things are far better. In my sector, which is highly technical, there is genuinely no equality problem. All that matters is that you're good at the job. I disagree that the UK is one of the worst, France and southern Europe are considerably more sexist.

It has stalled because the term 'feminist' was weaponised against women. There was a backlash and women were made to feel guilty or apologetic for claiming to be a feminist. being a self proclaimed feminist opened one up to being insulted as a hairy-legged man hater. Today many women deny being a feminist because they don't want to be seen as 'unfeminine' ball-breakers. The women haters did a good job on us, gas- lighting us. Women need to take back control over the word feminist and be proud of it. Generations of women suffered for it, we cant let them down. Now, even the word 'woman' is a minefield.

As a teenager I was looking forward to entering the workplace when the The Equal Pay Act of 1970 was passed. It was never properly enforced and it didn't take long for men to bring vexatious cases under it, claiming that rare instances of women being well-paid infringed their rights.

And of course, women are still paid less than men – a gender pay gap that has actually widened over the last year.
 Who is the Equalities Minister? Ah yes, Liz Truss. It is obvious that the role has been sidelined as how is she supposed to do that 
and be Foreign Sec? No problems with 
her pay though.

A lot of it is down to the old school tie network of mainly private school educated males. 
Those that go to Eton and other private schools primarily get the best jobs in the UK - there’s no disputing that, the City and Civil service and significant private business is full of them, and without specific quota legislation like in the US that gives BAME people opportunities, the people running the UK - so so poorly one might add - will do their best to limit others chances. 
The reason for stalling Women’s progress is well off men setting the rules in their favour.
