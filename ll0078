Pass notes No 2,914: Androgyny



The study of robot genitals? And stop guessing. Androgyny means straddling the divide between male and female characteristics.

Like fighting a bear and sobbing quietly at the same time? Not really, no. It's more of a look.

Half baleful glare, half coquettish pout? More or less. The last six months have seen an explosion of new andro-celebs.

Celebrities with robot genitals? Is that what caused the explosion? Please stop.

Fine, tell me about this new army of andro-stars. Sure, let's begin with the musicians. First there was breakthrough album The Arch-Android from tuxedo-wearing R&B singer Janelle Monae, then Lady Gaga made headlines by manning up in a suit as her alter-ego Jo Calderone for Japanese magazine Vogue Homme.

And outside of tomboy pop stars? The latest issue of bi-annual fashion magazine Love is an "androgyny chic" special, with a front cover featuring transgender model Lea T locked in a passionate embrace with supermodel Kate Moss, in turn made up like Danny from Grease in a quiff and leather jacket.

Is this Lea T girl any relation to Mr? Probably not. Lea T, born male but currently undergoing hormone treatment, is the latest muse of Givenchy's creative director Riccardo Tisci. And she's not the only transgender beauty making waves in the fashion world. Last week saw "femiman" supermodel Andrej Pejic close Jean Paul Gaultier's James Bond-inspired catwalk show in a fur waistcoat, high heels, stockings and luscious long blond hair.

So fashion's going transsexy? Absolutely. Even the designers are getting into the spirit, with Marc Jacobs posing in a range of ladies' clothes for the latest issue of aptly named fashion industry magazine Industrie.

Meaning gender is so last year? Exactly. All hail the arch-androgynoid.

Do say: "Goodbye Topman, hello Topwoman!"
